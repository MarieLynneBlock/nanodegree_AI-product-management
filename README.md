## Course Projects üèóÔ∏è

### ü©ª Create a Medical Image Annotation Job

In this project, we designed a product aimed at assisting doctors in quickly identifying cases of pneumonia in children. The goal was to develop a classification system that could:

- Flag serious cases
- Quickly identify healthy cases
- Act as a diagnostic aid for doctors

We started by building a labeled dataset capable of distinguishing between healthy and pneumonia x-ray images. This dataset would later serve as a foundation for machine learning engineers to construct a classification product.

We used the [Chest x-ray dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia), with labels removed, and every data point is a chest x-ray image. The images vary in size and exposure times.

<div align="center">
  <p>A typical, labeled image is shown below:</p>
  <img src="images/annotated-chest-xray.png" alt="healthy annotated-chest-xray example" width="500">
</div>

<br>

The challenge in this project lies in the fact that it is not always clear when pneumonia symptoms are present in an image. Thus, the system is not intended to replace a doctor, but rather to aid in quickly identifying healthy patients and highlighting potential cases of pneumonia.

To address this challenge, we designed a data annotation job suitable for a non-expert to identify more noticeable cases of pneumonia. We planned for uncertainty in data labels and incorporated test questions to capture this uncertainty.

Below are some visual examples demonstrating the characteristics of a healthy image and symptoms of pneumonia:

  <p>Characteristics of a healthy image: a clear lung area.</p>

</div>

<br>

Our main deliverables for this project were an HTML file of a complete job Preview, which includes instructions for annotation and example test questions, and a Proposal document discussing the job's design and quality assurance steps.

In our annotator instructions, we acknowledged the challenging nature of the classification task and provided clear examples and instructions to potential annotators. We offered an 'Unknown' or 'Other' option to account for uncertainty in an annotation and allowed annotators to indicate their confidence level in the presence of pneumonia symptoms on a numerical scale.

This project was a valuable experience in dataset creation, annotation job design, handling uncertainty, and planning for quality assurance.

### ü©∫ Develop & Train Classification Models for Pneumonia Detection

In this extension of the project, we aimed to use the curated medical image dataset (supra) to build different machine learning models capable of discerning pneumonia in chest x-rays. The ultimate goals are:

- To swiftly identify uncomplicated cases.
- To serve as a reliable red-flag mechanism for serious cases.
- To act as an adjunct to a doctor's diagnostic process.

<br>

#### 1. Binary Classifier for Pneumonia Detection

Utilizing a balanced dataset "normal" and "pneumonia" images, we trained a basic binary classifier. Key areas of evaluation included:

- **Train/test split:** Understanding the partition between training and validation sets.
- **Confusion matrix:** Interpreting each cell in the matrix.
- **Precision & recall:** Understanding and calculating these key metrics.

<br>

#### 2. Unbalanced Binary Classifier 

To explore the effects of data imbalance, we trained a model on a dataset of 1/3 of "normal" than "pneumonia" images. This exercise aimed to understand:

- **Confusion matrix:** Insights into the behavior of skewed data.
- **Precision & recall:** How these metrics are affected in an unbalanced setting.
- **Unbalanced Classes:** The impact on the machine learning model.

<br>

#### 3. Binary Classifier with Dirty Data

In this model, we introduced data noise by mislabeling 1/10 of the images in each category. This aimed to assess:

- **Confusion matrix:** How dirty data affects the matrix.
- **Precision & recall:** Changes in these metrics due to data noise.
- **Dirty data:** The overall impact on the machine learning model.

<br> 

#### 4. Tri-Class Model for Pneumonia Types

For a more detailed diagnosis, we trained a model to differentiate between "normal," "bacterial pneumonia," and "viral pneumonia". Evaluation included:

- **Confusion matrix:** The behavior in a multi-class setting.
- **Precision & recall:** Calculation and evaluation of these metrics for multiple classes.
- **More Data:** Exploration of data augmentation techniques to reach an 85% threshold for precision and recall, and assessing the volume of data needed.

<br>

After intensive model training, all findings, analyses, and visual representations are documented in the **AutoML Modeling Report**. We recommend referring to this report for detailed insights <here>

This project was an invaluable experience in not just model development but also in understanding the complexities of medical diagnostics, striving for models that are versatile and resilient across diverse scenarios.
