00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,044
There we are. In machine learning,

2
00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:06,285
the training data is key to building robust AI.

3
00:00:06,285 --> 00:00:09,120
We rely on the data to give the machine

4
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:12,809
all the insights needed to process the real-world data.

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:17,969
If we remain aware of the types of data the model will encounter in the wild,

6
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:22,410
then we can tailor our training data to encompass as many cases as possible.

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,949
While it may not be feasible to cover every corner case,

8
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:28,199
over time we can monitor the performance of

9
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:31,500
the model and understand where the model performance is weak,

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,765
and update the model as necessary.

11
00:00:33,765 --> 00:00:35,185
In the next section,

12
00:00:35,185 --> 00:00:38,539
we'll go over exactly how to evaluate your models,

13
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:42,590
to understand where the model is performing well and where the model is lacking.

14
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,480
This will allow us to ensure,

15
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,809
that the models we build will be successful when put into production.
