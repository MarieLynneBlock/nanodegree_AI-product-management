00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
So when thinking about building ML inter products,

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,629
we can now look at the different options of build versus buy.

3
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:11,699
With automated ML, you will get easy setup and robust enterprise support.

4
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:15,089
But this will come at a cost of limited use cases and

5
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:19,050
possibly sharing sensitive data with a third party provider.

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,000
On the flip side,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,605
with building a custom model,

8
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:26,324
the possibilities of customization are left to the imagination.

9
00:00:26,324 --> 00:00:30,910
But the drawback is that it can be costly to build and manage.
