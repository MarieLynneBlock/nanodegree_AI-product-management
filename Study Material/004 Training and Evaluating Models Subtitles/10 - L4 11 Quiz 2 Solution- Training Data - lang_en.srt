1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
In this quiz, we wanted you to identify what type of

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,929
trading data is best used for creating a voice assistant for a hotel concierge service.

3
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:11,519
When we look at the options,

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,250
we can immediately start to eliminate a few of them.

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,140
If we look at option B,

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:21,539
we see that it's calling for 10,000 images of hotel concierge activities.

7
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:25,829
We can immediately remove this because in order to train a voice assistant,

8
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:28,859
image data is unlikely to be of any use.

9
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:32,700
Similarly, we can eliminate option D because that is calling for

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,055
video data which is essentially a series of images connected together.

11
00:00:38,054 --> 00:00:40,890
Then, we have options A and C.

12
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,490
Option A, while it is collecting the correct type of data,

13
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:49,910
we see that it only is collecting two hours of audio data which is unlikely

14
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:55,899
to capture all of the types of scenarios that you may encounter in a hotel concierge.

15
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:58,079
That leaves us with option C.

16
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,754
Ten hours of audio data of

17
00:01:00,755 --> 00:01:03,725
concierge desk conversation and 50 hours of

18
00:01:03,725 --> 00:01:07,370
audio data from the most common guest-concierge interactions.

19
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,460
As you can see this will capture a fair amount

20
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:13,594
of real-world data as well as diverse data from

21
00:01:13,594 --> 00:01:16,444
different locations which will provide us

22
00:01:16,444 --> 00:01:20,759
with a sufficient dataset to train our voice assistant.
