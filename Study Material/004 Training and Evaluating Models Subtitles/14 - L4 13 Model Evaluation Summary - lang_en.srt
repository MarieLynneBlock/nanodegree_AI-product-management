1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
That sums up our model evaluation.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,280
We use test data to calculate the precision and recall for each class on the model,

3
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:11,304
as well as an overall model Precision and Recall.

4
00:00:11,304 --> 00:00:14,550
We use the metrics to calculate an F1 score,

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,640
which gives us an overall performance measure of the model,

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,710
taking into account correctly and incorrectly predicted examples for all classes.

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,050
We also plotted the predictions on

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,920
a confusion matrix to get into where model biases may occur,

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,954
and which classes we should focus on their future trading cycles.

10
00:00:32,954 --> 00:00:37,339
Next, we will talk about transfer learning and automated ML.

11
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,460
These are two facets of machine learning that have made

12
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,030
the development of ML models more accessible to developers,

13
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,850
as well as to individuals who may not have had

14
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,670
as much engineering or scientific background
