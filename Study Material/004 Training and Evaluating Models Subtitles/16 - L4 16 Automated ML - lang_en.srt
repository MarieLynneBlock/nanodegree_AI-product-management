1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,504
Coming to automated machine learning.

2
00:00:02,504 --> 00:00:06,074
This is where Cloud service providers such as Google Cloud and

3
00:00:06,075 --> 00:00:09,990
IBM Watson offer ML model creation services.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,589
The way these services work are that you bring your labeled data to

5
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:18,644
the platform and they will automatically train and tune the model to fit your case.

6
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:21,300
This allows you to easily build and test

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,230
an ML model with little additional work to actually serve the model.

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,984
One major benefit along with this platform will come enterprise support.

9
00:00:29,984 --> 00:00:35,564
This combination offers an overall solution with significantly less complexity.

10
00:00:35,564 --> 00:00:39,109
An added benefit of using these services is that

11
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:42,964
many of them will conduct neural architecture search on the back-end.

12
00:00:42,965 --> 00:00:46,670
This will automatically select the optimal architecture for

13
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:51,890
your model by fitting various components together and assessing their accuracy.

14
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,670
All of this will be handled by the service provider and is often

15
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:00,030
how they're able to effectively scale their ML solutions.
