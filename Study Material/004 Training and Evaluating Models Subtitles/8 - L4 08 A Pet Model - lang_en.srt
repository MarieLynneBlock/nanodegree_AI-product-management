1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,504
Here, we want to train a model that can determine the type of pet in an image.

2
00:00:05,504 --> 00:00:11,144
To start, we have batches of labeled data that are fed into the Network for training.

3
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:13,394
Once a network is trained,

4
00:00:13,394 --> 00:00:16,725
it retains all the knowledge learned from the example images.

5
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:19,320
In this case, there are two classes of animals that are

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,304
represented in the model; cat and dog.

7
00:00:22,304 --> 00:00:27,064
Now, when the model sees a new image that is not previously seen,

8
00:00:27,065 --> 00:00:30,515
it is able to predict the animal contained in the image.

9
00:00:30,515 --> 00:00:34,414
As we can see, this works great with images of dogs.

10
00:00:34,414 --> 00:00:37,700
Similarly, if we feed in this image here,

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,020
the model is able to determine that this is a cat.

12
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:45,800
In these examples, we can see that if the model is given unknown data,

13
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:48,589
as long as that data similar to the training data,

14
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,530
then it is able to infer the content of that data.

15
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,234
In this case, cats and dogs.

16
00:00:54,234 --> 00:00:57,740
Now, if we feed this image into the data,

17
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,890
this proves problematic because the pet contained in

18
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,480
this model is not one that is represented in the training data.

19
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,670
Therefore, a cute gerbil was assigned the label of

20
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,629
cat since the model only has knowledge of cats and dogs.

21
00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:14,239
In order to remedy this situation,

22
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,054
we can train the model on a third class of gerbil images.

23
00:01:18,055 --> 00:01:22,380
Now, the model is aware of the gerbil class of pets.

24
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:25,155
When we feed this image into the model,

25
00:01:25,155 --> 00:01:28,489
we now indeed get the correctly predicted label of gerbil.

26
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:33,229
Now, we can see that if the model is not given a particular type of data,

27
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,560
it will never be able to infer on other types of that data.

28
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,219
Only after being trained on a given type or class of data,

29
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:43,709
will the model begin to make predictions of that type.
