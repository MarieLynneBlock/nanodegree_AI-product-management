1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,625
Here are the concepts we'll cover in this lesson.

2
00:00:02,625 --> 00:00:05,549
We will start with a look at the actual models used in

3
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:10,349
machine learning and understand the components that make up this technology.

4
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:15,419
Next, we will talk about the training data which someone called the currency of ML.

5
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:19,410
Training data serves as the examples from which the machine will learn.

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,125
Subsequently, after training any model,

7
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:24,509
we need to understand the model's performance,

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,859
and we'll follow with the discussion of model evaluation and what key metrics we

9
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:33,600
want to measure to understand how our model is likely to perform in production.

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,740
Finally, we will talk about transfer learning.

11
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,070
A core concept in modern-day machine learning that allows

12
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:44,329
us to bootstrap models and achieve robust performance relatively quickly,

13
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:48,409
as well as automated ML which has made machine learning more accessible to

14
00:00:48,409 --> 00:00:54,149
individuals looking to develop performance AI without requiring a PhD in data science.

15
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:57,820
But that said, let's dive into the first section.
