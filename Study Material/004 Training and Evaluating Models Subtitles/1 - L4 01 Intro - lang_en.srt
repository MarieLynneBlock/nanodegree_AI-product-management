00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,759
Hi, my name is Kiran Vajapey.

2
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:05,804
I'm a senior HCI developer at Figure Eight.

3
00:00:05,804 --> 00:00:09,660
Today I'm going to talk to you about Machine Learning and Automated ML.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,500
I'm very excited to talk to you about this lesson. So let's dive in.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,199
In this lesson, we're going to dive deeper into

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,265
Machine Learning and understand the concepts behind ML models.

7
00:00:20,265 --> 00:00:24,530
You will see how we train models to carry out complex tasks by

8
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:29,765
observing historical data and tuning parameters to do this with high accuracy.

9
00:00:29,765 --> 00:00:33,170
As a product manager looking to develop AI products,

10
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,454
it is important to understand the mechanics of Machine Learning.

11
00:00:36,454 --> 00:00:41,089
Model architecture, training data and model evaluation are all

12
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:46,600
key elements of ML and are instrumental in successful AI product management.

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,865
When using AI and products,

14
00:00:48,865 --> 00:00:51,710
there are numerous uncertainties that can alter the course of

15
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,859
development and by understanding the core concepts,

16
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:58,594
we can stay ahead of the unknowns and plan development accordingly.

17
00:00:58,594 --> 00:01:02,670
The concepts in this lesson will cover various aspects of Machine Learning,

18
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,984
some more technical than others.

19
00:01:04,984 --> 00:01:09,680
If at any point you find yourself lost in the technical weeds, don't worry.

20
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,420
These topics are meant to give you a peek under the hood of

21
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,200
ML and get familiar with some of the components.

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,240
When building AI products,

23
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:20,388
you are very likely to interact with experts in the field,

24
00:01:20,388 --> 00:01:22,670
and knowing some of the lingo will allow you to

25
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,204
be more effective when managing these products.

26
00:01:25,204 --> 00:01:27,629
So let's get started.
