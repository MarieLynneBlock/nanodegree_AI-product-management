1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
In this quiz, we wanted you to calculate the overall performance of

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,804
this model given the confusion matrix and these ground truth labels.

3
00:00:08,804 --> 00:00:11,865
The intuition for this answer,

4
00:00:11,865 --> 00:00:16,440
is we calculated the recall for each of the classes.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,150
We next calculated the precision for each of the classes as well,

6
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:24,854
and found the overall model recall and precision.

7
00:00:24,855 --> 00:00:26,760
Once we had these,

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,090
we plugged them into our formula for the F1 score and got

9
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:34,545
an overall model performance of 0.75.

10
00:00:34,545 --> 00:00:39,179
This gives us a good indication that the model is performing well,

11
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:42,399
but could still benefit from additional training.
