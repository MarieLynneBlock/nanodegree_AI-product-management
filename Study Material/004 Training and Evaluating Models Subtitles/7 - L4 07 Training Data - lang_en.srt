1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now, we're going to talk about training data.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,700
Training data is the currency of machine learning

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,835
and is the basis of learning component in ML.

4
00:00:08,835 --> 00:00:12,089
A good way to think about neural networks in the context of

5
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:16,425
training data is to imagine a young child that has never seen a car.

6
00:00:16,425 --> 00:00:19,350
After being told what a car is and interacting with

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,335
different types of vehicles such as buses and trucks,

8
00:00:22,335 --> 00:00:27,375
the child will eventually learn what a car is and can identify them in the future.

9
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:32,789
Similarly, a machine learns by looking at many examples of a given object and

10
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:35,280
will eventually learn that a pattern and data can

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,145
be associated with a specific classification.

12
00:00:38,145 --> 00:00:42,470
Now, unlike children, machines are much more difficult to train and

13
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:47,015
require special care and attention to ensure they're learning the correct concepts.

14
00:00:47,015 --> 00:00:51,575
In machine learning, the data is key to model performance and outcomes.

15
00:00:51,575 --> 00:00:54,859
If you want a model to learn a specific concept,

16
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:57,064
it must be clearly represented in the data

17
00:00:57,064 --> 00:00:59,704
in order for the machine to learn it for the future.

18
00:00:59,704 --> 00:01:02,059
This means that for example,

19
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,635
if you want a machine to learn to detect animal sounds and audio,

20
00:01:05,635 --> 00:01:07,984
you must provide the machine with examples

21
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:11,030
of all the types of animals you would like it to learn.

22
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:16,790
Furthermore, if the data used to train the models inaccurate for example,

23
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,460
you have humans making these animal noises,

24
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:21,589
then it is unlikely to work on real

25
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:25,865
animal sounds as it has only learned simulated human sounds.

26
00:01:25,864 --> 00:01:29,689
With that said, let's go through an example of training a model to

27
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:34,239
see how the model behaves given different types of training data.
