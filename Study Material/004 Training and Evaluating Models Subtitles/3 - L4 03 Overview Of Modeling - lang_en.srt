00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,119
Modelling and machine learning consists of constructing

2
00:00:03,119 --> 00:00:07,665
the core components that will serve as the framework for a machine-learning model.

3
00:00:07,665 --> 00:00:11,940
Neural networks are some of the most common models used in ML.

4
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:14,250
So for the purposes of this lesson,

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,085
we will focus on this specific type of model.

6
00:00:17,085 --> 00:00:21,510
A single neural network is made up of numerous computational layers.

7
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,090
Each of these layers will pass a decision to

8
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:27,149
the subsequent layer until reaching the output layer,

9
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:30,390
which will produce a final decision for the input data.

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,054
The data that goes into the network is a set of values.

11
00:00:34,054 --> 00:00:35,854
These values, for example,

12
00:00:35,854 --> 00:00:39,664
could be pixels contained in an image or audio waveform.

13
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:43,339
This image shows an example of network with three layers;

14
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,485
two hidden layers and an output layer.

15
00:00:45,484 --> 00:00:47,269
When counting the number of layers,

16
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,915
we generally count all the layers after the input layer.

17
00:00:50,914 --> 00:00:54,259
Each layer is made up of some number of nodes,

18
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:58,564
each of which has its own parameters that describe the data flow through the network.

19
00:00:58,564 --> 00:01:02,299
Neural networks are sometimes referred to as deep neural networks,

20
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:06,034
simply because of the deep number of layers contained in the network.

21
00:01:06,034 --> 00:01:08,104
Before a network is trained,

22
00:01:08,105 --> 00:01:12,665
there is an architecture that is defined and used throughout the life of the model.

23
00:01:12,665 --> 00:01:17,510
There's a process known as neural architecture search that further optimizes

24
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,120
the creation of a neural network by swapping out and

25
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,365
testing different architectures as the model is trained.

26
00:01:23,364 --> 00:01:25,589
We will go into this a bit later.

27
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,900
But to start, we should understand that a neural network is a series of layers,

28
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,370
each of which contains different nodes which will perform various calculations.

29
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:37,490
The structure of these nodes and layers as well as how they're

30
00:01:37,489 --> 00:01:41,459
connected is what is known as the architecture of the network.
