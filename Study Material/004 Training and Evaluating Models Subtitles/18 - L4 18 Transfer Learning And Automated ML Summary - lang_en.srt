00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,370
That's the end of this section.

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,890
We saw how transfer learning can be used to

3
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:07,679
leverage knowledge from other models to speed up

4
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:10,109
the creation of new ones by copying a portion of

5
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:13,439
the first model and tuning it for a specific need.

6
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:16,980
People often post pre-trained models online,

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,280
which had been trained on thousands or millions of data points and

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,150
often serve as a great starting point for model development.

9
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:28,079
Automated ML is another segment of machine learning where

10
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,280
service providers will offer tools to create ML models.

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,299
Generally, these platforms will have a limited set of use cases.

12
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:42,099
If there's a need for more complex models then a custom model may be the way to go.
