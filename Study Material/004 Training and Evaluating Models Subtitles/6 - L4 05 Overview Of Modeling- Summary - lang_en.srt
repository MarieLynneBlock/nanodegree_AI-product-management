00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,930
That's a high level overview of modeling and machine learning.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:08,775
We learn that Neural Networks are the basis for much of ML we see today.

3
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:13,410
These networks consist of nodes that are linked together through inputs and outputs with

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,375
activation functions that determine whether or not a node will forward information.

5
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:23,190
The most common activation functions are the Sigmoid and the Rayleigh functions,

6
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,859
because they produce a continuous output allowing for

7
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,085
a range of values pass from one node to another.

8
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:34,049
Weights on the inputs of each node are tuned and ultimately define the behavior

9
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:39,149
of data flowing through the network by throttling each inputs impact on the node.

10
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:42,379
Additionally, there are different types of nodes and

11
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:46,530
networks that are specialized for specific use cases.
