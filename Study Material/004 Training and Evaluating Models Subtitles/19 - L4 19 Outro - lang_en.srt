1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,384
That brings our lesson to a close.

2
00:00:02,384 --> 00:00:04,919
Hopefully now, you have a better understanding of

3
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:07,724
some of the components that make up machine learning.

4
00:00:07,724 --> 00:00:09,929
Machine learning models are defined by

5
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:13,425
their architecture and the training data used to train them.

6
00:00:13,425 --> 00:00:16,844
In order to use machine learning models in production,

7
00:00:16,844 --> 00:00:19,335
we want to thoroughly evaluate the performance,

8
00:00:19,335 --> 00:00:24,135
so we are aware of the model and how it's likely to perform when deployed.

9
00:00:24,135 --> 00:00:28,970
In machine learning, there are certain tools such as transfer learning and automated

10
00:00:28,969 --> 00:00:33,649
ML that we can use as aids to help us build models faster.

11
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:35,329
In the following project,

12
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:38,914
you'll get first-hand experience at creating your own ML models

13
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:44,070
and getting intuition for how the data impacts the outcome of each model.
