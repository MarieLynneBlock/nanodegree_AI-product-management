1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
So in this quiz we wanted to identify

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:07,140
which of these statements are true about activation functions.

3
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:08,924
Going through the list,

4
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:12,315
we see the option A discusses thresholds.

5
00:00:12,314 --> 00:00:16,484
We saw that using thresholds are not the best options,

6
00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:18,794
because they act as step functions,

7
00:00:18,795 --> 00:00:23,865
which simply return a zero or one instead of a continuous value.

8
00:00:23,864 --> 00:00:28,619
Looking at the next option we do actually like sigmoids,

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,410
because they return a continuous range between zero and

10
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,179
one allowing a range of decisions rather than simply yes or no.

11
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:38,310
Looking at C and D,

12
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,484
we see that these are both discussing ReLU functions.

13
00:00:41,484 --> 00:00:43,530
However, in option C,

14
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,515
it says that they are linear from negative infinity to infinity which is incorrect.

15
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:54,259
ReLU functions in fact have different slopes below zero and above zero.

16
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:59,500
This is why we select B and D as the correct options.
