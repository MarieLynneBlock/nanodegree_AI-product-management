1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,029
This is a typical machine learning training pipeline that

2
00:00:03,029 --> 00:00:06,150
many machine learning teams use to start building products.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,210
They typically start and have a dataset that's available to them,

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,490
they may spend some time cleaning or

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,640
organizing and jump right into building a model of training it,

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,130
validating it, and then straight to deployment.

7
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:20,140
I see this time and time again.

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,550
I spent three years at IBM Watson actually trying to make this stuff work in reality,

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,719
and what I found was that you actually need to

10
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:30,335
start with the business problem not the data.

11
00:00:30,335 --> 00:00:33,660
At Figure Eight, we work with about 200 enterprise clients who were actively

12
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:37,409
running real production jobs and getting business value out of it.

13
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:40,169
If they weren't getting business value, they wouldn't pay for it.

14
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,280
Our most successful clients start with the business problem and

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,340
one of these steps you could spend months refining,

16
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,415
optimizing, clarifying, and digging into more.

17
00:00:49,414 --> 00:00:51,909
It's about figuring out how to start small and narrow,

18
00:00:51,909 --> 00:00:54,799
and then expanding as you realize the business value.

19
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:59,199
The business problem is often the hardest part by far,

20
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,700
and it's critical part of what product managers

21
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,579
should focus on and exactly what problem you're solving.

22
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:07,189
For example, I made this mistake when I first worked

23
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:09,829
on computer vision which is that we just said, "Oh,

24
00:01:09,829 --> 00:01:14,030
we want to recognize stuff from images and I didn't clarify it any further",

25
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:17,870
that did not end up being a particularly successful product and market for V1.

26
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,960
It was only later when V2, and V3,

27
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:22,384
and V4, when I narrow the business problem,

28
00:01:22,385 --> 00:01:24,890
that we wanted to actually build an API for

29
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,489
developers to train and recognize custom visual content that

30
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:31,159
they cared about in their business when we ended up with

31
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:35,179
a very successful business application and product that did well.

32
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:38,090
Let's go through a couple of these steps.

33
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,784
First, again, business problem,

34
00:01:40,784 --> 00:01:41,939
you have to define it,

35
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:43,859
you need to quantify the value,

36
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:46,459
you need to identify who those stakeholders are,

37
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:48,799
what's the priority of this business problem

38
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,069
relative to everything else that you have going on in your business,

39
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:53,479
and what level of investment are

40
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,660
those stake holders willing to make to solve this problem.

41
00:01:56,659 --> 00:02:00,019
You can spend days, weeks, or months,

42
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:03,754
just defining the business problem and getting people support.

43
00:02:03,754 --> 00:02:05,390
Once you've done that,

44
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,615
then you can move on to actually the data problem.

45
00:02:08,615 --> 00:02:12,515
You need to figure out. Do you have the right data to solve the business problem?

46
00:02:12,514 --> 00:02:14,449
What's the provenance of that data?

47
00:02:14,449 --> 00:02:17,239
Are there any security issues or PII issues,

48
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,025
you should be thinking of?

49
00:02:19,025 --> 00:02:20,930
What's the coverage of that dataset?

50
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,310
Does it need to be cleaned, or augmented,

51
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,460
or annotated in any way in order to

52
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,120
hand it off successfully to your machine-learning team?

53
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,129
What's your strategy for refreshing the data and having

54
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:34,099
a pipeline of development of that data over time,

55
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:36,710
so that your model will continue to stay

56
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:40,195
fresh to solve the actual business pane at the beginning?

57
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:43,780
Only then should you move on to model-building.

58
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,219
This is where the machine-learning team typically gets involved,

59
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:47,794
you can do feature extraction,

60
00:02:47,794 --> 00:02:51,049
tune the hyperparameters, and benchmark against

61
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:55,040
different datasets and different validators.

62
00:02:55,039 --> 00:03:00,069
Once you've actually built a model that you're happy with from an accuracy perspective,

63
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:02,060
then you can go and actually deploy it.

64
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,780
I see lots and lots of people stalling here,

65
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,759
which is that they built a model of an ends up

66
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:10,704
sitting on the shelf and not actually deployed.

67
00:03:10,705 --> 00:03:15,920
You want to make sure you have a clear path as a product manager to deploying that model,

68
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:17,599
because if the model sitting on the shelf

69
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,699
you're never going to realize your business value.

70
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:24,259
Setting up ways to AB test perhaps different versions of that model,

71
00:03:24,259 --> 00:03:30,245
or tuning different outcomes and integrating it seamlessly into the business process.

72
00:03:30,245 --> 00:03:33,230
Once you've deployed your model into production,

73
00:03:33,229 --> 00:03:39,044
it's time to actively learn in a production environment need to mitigate unwanted bias,

74
00:03:39,044 --> 00:03:44,405
such as, was your dataset actually complete for the real world like you thought it was?

75
00:03:44,405 --> 00:03:47,449
Making sure that you're refreshing your ground truth,

76
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:51,034
monitoring for success against not just the accuracy or

77
00:03:51,034 --> 00:03:55,669
an F1 score as often things that a machine-learning team will use to measure success,

78
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:58,969
but accuracy against solving your business problem.

79
00:03:58,969 --> 00:04:00,935
What kind of versions do you need?

80
00:04:00,935 --> 00:04:02,240
Rinse and repeat.

81
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,360
Again, you could do this entire problem in a day, a week,

82
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,690
or a month depending on your business problem, the size of it,

83
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:10,324
the availability of the data,

84
00:04:10,324 --> 00:04:13,439
and the team that you're working with to execute.
