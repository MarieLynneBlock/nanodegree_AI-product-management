1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,270
So often an e-commerce Company will come and say,

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,519
"hey I just want to improve sight conversion and I

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:07,769
want to use Machine Learning to do that."

4
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:11,218
High level business executives get super excited about this,

5
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:15,390
but breaking it down into a narrow and specific problem is critical for success.

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,574
So what that often results into is improving search results.

7
00:00:19,574 --> 00:00:22,559
Improving search results really means improving the

8
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,054
click-through on the top 10 search results returned

9
00:00:26,054 --> 00:00:29,730
which in particular cases could be around

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,960
improving the percent of Hero Images which feature the actual product.

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,210
So Home Depot had this problem and what they found

12
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:42,740
was that when a search result had a product image which was shown by

13
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,850
itself against a white background that converted a lot higher than what they call

14
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,160
lifestyle images which were products that were shown in

15
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:52,574
the context of a room with a lot of their furniture.

16
00:00:52,575 --> 00:00:56,120
So they had this huge image database and there

17
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:59,119
were no tags on image database to distinguish for

18
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,390
the software developers which image to show if there were

19
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:07,375
five or six images per product which ones do they show in the search results.

20
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:11,090
They needed to tag all of these images and delineate

21
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,555
between these two different styles.

22
00:01:13,555 --> 00:01:19,610
So this breaks down into a pretty simple image classification problem saying,

23
00:01:19,609 --> 00:01:21,739
"hey, what type of image is this?

24
00:01:21,739 --> 00:01:23,359
Is this a product image or is it

25
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:28,239
a lifestyle image or is it something else in my data that I'm not aware of?"

26
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:31,879
So I went to search for new towel bar the other day and

27
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:35,060
I could not find a search result that did not have

28
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,329
a product hero image featuring that where

29
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:39,709
should have been in the search results

30
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:45,109
and the lifestyle images were all correctly placed in a different section.

31
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:48,859
I searched long and hard to see if there were any that were out of

32
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:53,034
place and it looks like they really nailed this using machine-learning.

33
00:01:53,034 --> 00:01:55,340
Switching gears a little bit,

34
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,469
say you're a large retailer.

35
00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:02,030
This is a company that works with retailers Bossanova

36
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,859
and they deploy robots that

37
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:07,040
go up and down the aisles and figure out what

38
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,569
is out of stock to help improve the store experience.

39
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:14,599
So really the business problem here that they're solving for is improving

40
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:20,354
the customer experience and improving repeat customer business of that store.

41
00:02:20,354 --> 00:02:23,539
So to improve that store experience it's really about

42
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:26,509
making sure the percent of shelves are fully stocked.

43
00:02:26,509 --> 00:02:27,530
If you've ever gone into

44
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,620
a grocery store and things are out of stock, it's super annoying.

45
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,615
I don't want to go to another grocery store.

46
00:02:32,615 --> 00:02:36,110
That means you need to understand which products specifically are

47
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:40,430
understaffed and delineate from a computer vision perspective between

48
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,165
what a stock shelf look like and what an empty shelf look like and

49
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:48,139
also an OCR task around identifying exactly what product is

50
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:49,849
missing from that shelf.

51
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:52,264
Visually it could look like this.

52
00:02:52,264 --> 00:02:55,629
From the point of view of the robot going up and down the store,

53
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:57,715
they need to identify, "hey,

54
00:02:57,715 --> 00:03:00,219
this is a full shelf or this is an empty shell."

55
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:03,620
If it's empty here's what product is supposed to be there

56
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,240
and visually transcribing

57
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,159
what that is and sending that information to

58
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:11,034
the store associates to go restock that shelf.

59
00:03:11,034 --> 00:03:15,020
Alternatively, I've seen a lot of Machine Learning Projects stumble or

60
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,880
fail or not go anywhere interesting

61
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,115
because they aren't clear enough on the business problem.

62
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:23,689
Take for example, a fashion retailer who started with the data

63
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:25,069
they had which was lots of

64
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:28,159
imagery from fashion over the last 15 years and they wanted to

65
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,629
classify at all to understand what was in that whole image set.

66
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:34,669
However, simply classifying all the different fashion types

67
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:37,699
didn't really lead them to any valuable business outcome.

68
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:43,399
Besides a very loosely tag data-set of shirts and pants and purses.

69
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,260
It wasn't particularly meaningful.

70
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:50,120
Of course it's all fashion catalog because that's all the data that they have.

71
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,605
None of the business leader has got any value from this project.

72
00:03:53,604 --> 00:03:56,989
In summary here, you want to make sure that you are deploying for

73
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:00,439
a very targeted narrow and specific use case

74
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:03,319
that is measurable with business outcomes.

75
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:06,424
You want to put the business problem before the data.

76
00:04:06,425 --> 00:04:09,770
It's almost always better to start with a business case and

77
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:13,790
evaluate options for how to achieve success in that special case,

78
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:16,959
sometimes it's a Machine Learning problem, sometimes it's not.

79
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,294
Success depends on the data.

80
00:04:19,295 --> 00:04:22,879
Our AI systems are only as good as the data that we put into them.

81
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:27,180
If your data is bad, your Machine Learning tools are useless.
