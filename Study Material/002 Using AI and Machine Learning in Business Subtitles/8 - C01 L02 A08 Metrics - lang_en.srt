1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,350
So shifting gears a little bit,

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:03,750
let's talk about how to measure success.

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,815
Metrics. So what makes an effective metric?

4
00:00:07,815 --> 00:00:09,660
There's no one right answer here.

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,115
In my practice I like metrics that are easily measurable,

6
00:00:14,115 --> 00:00:17,160
directly correlate to business performance,

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,339
are actually predictive of future business outcomes,

8
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:24,420
and isolated to factors that I can control or the team can control,

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,690
and comparable to competitive or industry benchmarks,

10
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,780
so I can get a sense of how I stack up in the broader industry.
