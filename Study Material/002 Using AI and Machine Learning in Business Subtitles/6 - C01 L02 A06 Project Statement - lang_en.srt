1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,209
So typically, when you're building an AI product,

2
00:00:03,209 --> 00:00:05,519
you're going to create what's called a project statement.

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:08,234
As a product manager it's really cleared to

4
00:00:08,234 --> 00:00:11,709
communicate to your stakeholders what problem are we solving.

5
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,520
In this case, we are helping marketers find

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,109
the right stock images for

7
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:19,619
marketing collateral in order to improve their conversion on sales.

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:25,245
We're trying to be really specific on where the AI is going to add value.

9
00:00:25,245 --> 00:00:29,130
In this case, it'll tag images or it'll search for

10
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:33,405
images with the right qualities thus making image search a lot more efficient.

11
00:00:33,405 --> 00:00:36,359
We also have a clear set of data that's needed,

12
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:40,590
stocked images tagged with aesthetic qualities that are visually

13
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,010
aligned to one another and data that

14
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:46,780
specifies how similar one set of images is to another.

15
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,365
From a scope perspective as well,

16
00:00:49,365 --> 00:00:53,780
this is when the user needs to find a stock photo for marketing collateral,

17
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,759
you'll want to select the best option based on

18
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:59,159
all variables to improve that conversion rate.

19
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,905
How do we measure success?

20
00:01:01,905 --> 00:01:06,655
This is when users need to find the best stock image quickly.

21
00:01:06,655 --> 00:01:10,790
This can also probably be expanded on in our metrics section quickly,

22
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,865
could be within 30 seconds, within five minutes.

23
00:01:13,864 --> 00:01:15,679
What metrics specifically from

24
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,530
a business outcome are you going to use to measure success?
