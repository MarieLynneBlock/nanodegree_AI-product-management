1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,339
So let's end here with project management,

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:06,105
and getting this actually as a team into production.

3
00:00:06,105 --> 00:00:07,890
So I'm often asked here,

4
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:09,554
how much time will this take?

5
00:00:09,554 --> 00:00:11,265
The answer is it depends.

6
00:00:11,265 --> 00:00:13,890
No different from normal Scrum and Agile.

7
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,570
I highly recommend Scrum.

8
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,260
This process could take a week, a day,

9
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:22,250
end to end or could take six months depending on how fast you can learn

10
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,420
and iterate.

11
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,530
I've spent months just tracking down the right dataset to use,

12
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,575
or I've seen teams spent three months doing

13
00:00:30,574 --> 00:00:34,250
feature and hyper-parameter tuning and specification,

14
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,515
or weeks training models.

15
00:00:36,515 --> 00:00:40,924
I've also seen models trained in five minutes using off the shelf products.

16
00:00:40,924 --> 00:00:43,399
Deploying and measuring really depends a lot on

17
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:45,739
your tooling and your infrastructure that you're using,

18
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,025
or if you're going to build that all from scratch.

19
00:00:48,024 --> 00:00:53,060
Again, it sometimes takes an hour to get stakeholders on

20
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,340
track depending on the size of your organization or it

21
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,650
could take six months in a highly matrix world.

22
00:00:57,649 --> 00:00:59,629
It totally depends.

23
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:03,085
It's important to use Scrum.

24
00:01:03,085 --> 00:01:08,150
Super normal, no different from normal development processes.

25
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,975
As the team you're doing backlog planning, sprint meeting, backlogs.

26
00:01:12,974 --> 00:01:16,969
A Scrum teams sprint can last anywhere from one to four weeks.

27
00:01:16,969 --> 00:01:20,929
There's lots of great online resources around Scrum and how to run that.

28
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:25,230
I believe Udacity also has some great courses. So check those out.
