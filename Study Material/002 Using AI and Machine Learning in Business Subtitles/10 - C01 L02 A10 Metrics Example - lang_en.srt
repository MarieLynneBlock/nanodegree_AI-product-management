1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,019
So another example using search is LinkedIn here.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,339
So LinkedIn has used machine learning technology to classify companies,

3
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:10,515
improving their job recommendations.

4
00:00:10,515 --> 00:00:15,300
They measure success here by increasing the initial in mail response rates.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,010
In this case, they were able to improve them by over 45 percent.

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,800
Another way they measure success is the number

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,019
of two-way conversation started.

8
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:27,975
Here, they were actually able to double that.

9
00:00:27,975 --> 00:00:30,810
So I know I get lots of job recommendations from LinkedIn,

10
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:32,729
and it looks like they've really improved

11
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:36,119
the outcomes based on implementing natural language processing,

12
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,530
and machine learning techniques.
