1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,274
So things to remember.

2
00:00:01,274 --> 00:00:03,209
Start with the business value,

3
00:00:03,209 --> 00:00:06,450
break it down into small and specific component of the process

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,724
that you want to improve.

5
00:00:07,724 --> 00:00:09,299
Get real with the data,

6
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,775
use production data, not academic data,

7
00:00:11,775 --> 00:00:14,699
not data that you found under the covers,

8
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:16,634
or under your bed, or under the mattress.

9
00:00:16,635 --> 00:00:18,960
You want to use production data to ensure that

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,010
the training data matches the reality of the real world deployment.

11
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,110
Learning is key to value.

12
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:29,879
Learning from new data ensures consistent improvement over time.

13
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:34,064
Let's take another example of a good candidate for machine learning.

14
00:00:34,064 --> 00:00:36,375
Take a customer support use case.

15
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:39,560
Costs on average about four dollars per chat conversation and

16
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,640
about nine dollars for

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,929
phone conversation when you're engaging with the customer support team.

18
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:45,950
Often, in tier one support,

19
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,630
there's a lot of repetitive content.

20
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,150
It's frustrating for the customer service department,

21
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:53,164
to deal with the same conversations over and over and over again,

22
00:00:53,164 --> 00:00:55,774
and it's difficult to scale up or down to

23
00:00:55,774 --> 00:00:59,060
predict how much volume will come in over a given time frame.

24
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,000
It can also be a huge cost center for the business.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,519
But, look at ways to add machine learning technology to improve this.

26
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:09,019
Let's take for example Autodesk,

27
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:11,375
which makes architecture and other business software.

28
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:13,325
They had exactly this problem.

29
00:01:13,325 --> 00:01:16,189
What they did, was turn to natural language processing

30
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:18,129
to automate as much as possible.

31
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:19,634
They started small.

32
00:01:19,635 --> 00:01:21,530
They started with a narrow business problem,

33
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,200
which was just password reset which represented

34
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,269
a meaningful percentage of inquiries that they

35
00:01:26,269 --> 00:01:28,144
got in their customer support center,

36
00:01:28,144 --> 00:01:31,039
and they taught a chatbot to recognize,

37
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,025
when the user's question was about a password reset,

38
00:01:34,025 --> 00:01:37,340
and they got the chatbot to help the customer automatically,

39
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,609
without involving a customer support representative.

40
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:43,670
When the natural language processing system recognized

41
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,530
that the customer inquiry was not about password reset,

42
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,245
the chat was routed to a live support system for resolution.

43
00:01:50,245 --> 00:01:52,240
Rinse and repeat over time,

44
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:54,424
they were able to add additional use cases,

45
00:01:54,424 --> 00:01:58,609
up to about 60 different types of use cases and ended up supporting a

46
00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:03,484
100,000 increase a day automatically using natural language processing.

47
00:02:03,484 --> 00:02:05,150
Excuse me, a month.

48
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,550
The business outcome here was that on average,

49
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:14,770
they cut the resolution time from before about a day and a half, to 5.4 minutes.

50
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,520
That's a lot happier customers.

51
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:22,324
As you can see here, it's often a mix.

52
00:02:22,324 --> 00:02:28,604
There is no magic solution here when deploying machine learning technology.

53
00:02:28,604 --> 00:02:31,914
It's a mix of keeping humans in the loop, in reality,

54
00:02:31,914 --> 00:02:36,239
and gradually expanding the use case overtime.
