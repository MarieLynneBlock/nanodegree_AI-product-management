1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
There is no one right answer in this case.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,300
However, one that would work well would be steps five through eight

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:08,969
which would be creating a visual based search

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,970
using machine learning computer vision technology.

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,050
Typically, this is called

6
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:17,745
a visual similarity search and it's deployed frequently on e-commerce websites.

7
00:00:17,745 --> 00:00:21,269
The customer of Adobe could use that image that they gathered in step

8
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:26,189
one and simply look for visually similar images using machine learning.

9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,960
The reason this is a good problem for machine learning is that,

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,560
one, you have a lot of data,

11
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:34,170
you have a clear sense of what the job is that needs to get done

12
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,385
and to be accomplished,

13
00:00:35,384 --> 00:00:39,799
and you have a job previously that is tedious and impossible for humans to

14
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:44,449
do in a realistic time-frame which is searched through a 120 million images.

15
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,000
Another tool that can help understand

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,549
the business problem is identifying the AI value and

17
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:52,009
spending time writing down the details of

18
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:55,009
what actively needs to get accomplished by that user.

19
00:00:55,009 --> 00:00:58,489
If that could be done by a human or by a machine learning and what

20
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:02,240
the value is of that narrow and granular or specific activity.

21
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,500
It can help you stack, rank,

22
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,560
and prioritize different opportunities for machine learning.

23
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,555
This also helps you identify what data is needed to accomplish a specific task.

24
00:01:11,555 --> 00:01:13,250
So two examples here,

25
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,950
the activity would be identifying images with

26
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,204
the corresponding visual aesthetic qualities.

27
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:24,185
Another one could be identifying images with space for Ad copy.

28
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:27,469
Here's how human would accomplish it versus an AI

29
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:31,679
and then being really clear on what the value and the outcome is there.
