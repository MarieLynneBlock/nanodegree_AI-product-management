1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,430
In this lesson, we are going to review how to actually build

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:06,640
successful products that use machine learning technology at scale.

3
00:00:07,429 --> 00:00:12,660
Here are several examples of ways real companies are using AI today

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,935
to realize value.

5
00:00:13,935 --> 00:00:16,100
In this lesson, we're going to talk about developing

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,545
AI application in a business setting.

7
00:00:18,545 --> 00:00:23,544
Some common things are facial recognition, retail inventory management,

8
00:00:23,544 --> 00:00:26,760
e-commerce search relevance, a lot of use cases

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,580
in customer support automation.

10
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:31,849
Yesterday, we talked about agricultural automation.

11
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:36,230
There's all types of use cases with data categorization and classification,

12
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:39,259
and lots of ways to manufacturer efficiency and

13
00:00:39,259 --> 00:00:42,609
quality control which are some of my personal favorite use cases.

14
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,774
Of course, things like OCR, autonomous vehicles,

15
00:00:45,774 --> 00:00:51,390
sentiment analysis is really popular in social media and marketing use cases.
