00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
It's one thing to build on my laptop,

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,375
it's a very different thing to deploy it to hundreds of thousands or millions of users.

3
00:00:06,375 --> 00:00:11,684
In reality, cross-functional teams are critical for driving business outcomes.

4
00:00:11,685 --> 00:00:16,440
You need a team that is made up of folks who cut across disciplines.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,815
You can also have multiple teams running in parallel.

6
00:00:19,815 --> 00:00:22,910
You'll need folks from product and design, engineers,

7
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:26,660
DevOps, QA, data engineering, data science.

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,240
From an HR perspective,

9
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:32,100
they may not all report into one team or a general manager.

10
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,289
They may report in functionally,

11
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:36,839
but in order to have a successful product launch,

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,740
you need folks representative of all of these different types of skill sets.
