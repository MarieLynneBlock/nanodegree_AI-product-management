1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,279
So there's no one right answer here.

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:04,830
However, these could all be correct answers.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,359
It could be time spent between searching and purchasing an image,

4
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:12,839
it could be number of images purchased per user,

5
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:17,535
it could be a net promoter score or a rating for search results,

6
00:00:17,535 --> 00:00:22,140
or perhaps percent of stock imagery purchased overall.

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,750
Lots of different answers could be correct here.

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:30,429
It's just important to understand what's most meaningful to Adobe's business overall.
