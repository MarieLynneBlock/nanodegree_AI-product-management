1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,714
Now, we'll discuss a couple of key roles.

2
00:00:02,714 --> 00:00:06,179
So obviously starting with the product owner.

3
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:07,919
This person owns the business case,

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,379
they bridge from stakeholders to the team,

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,500
they maximize the product value and they ensure

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,519
that the team builds the right product that's going to solve a business score.

7
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:21,719
Often overlooked, I think one of the most key positions on a team,

8
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:24,549
making sure that the team really focuses on the user,

9
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:29,115
is a designer The designer will own the Human-Computer Interaction Design.

10
00:00:29,114 --> 00:00:31,244
Take Amazon's Alexa's use case.

11
00:00:31,245 --> 00:00:33,480
The design here has really changed over time.

12
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:36,619
At first, Alexa simply didn't respond or showed

13
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:40,009
lights flashing when they didn't understand what I was saying.

14
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:42,530
It was a frustrating experience for me as a consumer.

15
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,460
Often, Alexa guessed wrong what I was trying to say

16
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,435
or she misinterpreted and let me down a path that I didn't want to go down.

17
00:00:50,435 --> 00:00:54,054
Now, when Alexa has low confidence about what I've said,

18
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,289
sometimes Alexa will ask me as the user to clarify

19
00:00:57,289 --> 00:01:01,159
my statement and confirm if it was interpreted correctly.

20
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:05,914
That's a much better experience for me as a user of the product.

21
00:01:05,915 --> 00:01:11,150
You absolutely need software engineers to actually build the product.

22
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:15,565
Front-end, back-end expertise who were building this problem infrastructure,

23
00:01:15,564 --> 00:01:19,099
they're problem-solving from a software development perspective

24
00:01:19,099 --> 00:01:21,589
and they're generally bringing things to life.

25
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:26,555
A newer role is a role that has developed recently called a data engineer.

26
00:01:26,555 --> 00:01:31,685
This person is often taking a model from a machine learning team and getting

27
00:01:31,685 --> 00:01:35,120
the data infrastructure and pipelines setup

28
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,870
to support rapid development in iteration after launch.

29
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,180
Often the state engineers also responsible for

30
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,525
model management or AB testing or validation.

31
00:01:44,525 --> 00:01:47,810
A data scientist will build and select a model,

32
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,394
they'll guide the team and state their research and technology,

33
00:01:51,394 --> 00:01:53,839
they'll structure the problem to actually achieve

34
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,795
the business metrics and we'll use data to answer those business problems.

35
00:01:58,795 --> 00:02:04,280
A Q&A team member will own the quality of the product outcome.

36
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,659
They'll speak the person who's signing off and that product is ready to release.

37
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:12,049
They'll do scalability testing and functional testing.

38
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:16,430
A DevOps team ensures the infrastructure and reliability.

39
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,710
They're managing scale and performance.

40
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,990
They're mitigating any security risks and their

41
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,420
ensuring smooth operations between

42
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:26,179
the machine learning team and the engineering team and

43
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:30,120
efficiency across the technical teams.
