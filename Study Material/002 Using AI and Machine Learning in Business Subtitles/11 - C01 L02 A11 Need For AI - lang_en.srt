00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,815
A question I get often is,

2
00:00:01,815 --> 00:00:03,764
do you even need AI?

3
00:00:03,765 --> 00:00:06,990
Not all projects are well-suited for AI or machine-learning.

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,080
Let's talk a little bit about what makes a project well-suited

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,539
for using this technology.

6
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:14,894
Some key considerations are:

7
00:00:14,894 --> 00:00:18,480
do you have an impactful business problem that warrants solving?

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,449
Is this problem big enough and important enough?

9
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:23,339
That's a high enough priority that you can

10
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:26,460
quantify the business value clearly and simply.

11
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,640
Does this problem have a huge volume of

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,890
associated data that the machine-learning technology can actually learn from?

13
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:37,244
Is that data well-organized and is it complete?

14
00:00:37,244 --> 00:00:40,169
How much data do you actually solve?

15
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,000
The data is the most critical piece of this problem here.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,564
So let's focus a little bit more on this.

17
00:00:46,564 --> 00:00:48,619
Just because you have a lot of data,

18
00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:51,049
doesn't necessarily mean it's the right data.

19
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:55,039
Does the dataset match the problem that you're trying to solve for?

20
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,780
Is that dataset complete?

21
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,800
Is that annotated correctly for the machine-learning team?

22
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:02,959
Does it have unwanted bias in it or anything else that

23
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,234
shouldn't be in that dataset that's likely to have a negative business outcome?

24
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:11,480
Spending a lot of time actually looking through your dataset and

25
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,484
samples of it in detail is absolutely critical as the product manager.

26
00:01:16,484 --> 00:01:22,260
You can't just relegate this task to the machine learning or data science test.
