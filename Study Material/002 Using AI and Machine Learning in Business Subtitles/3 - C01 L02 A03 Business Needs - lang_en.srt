1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,745
It's important to start with the problem not the data.

2
00:00:02,745 --> 00:00:05,280
You can imagine it's like trying to pack for a trip

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,115
but you don't know the destination.

4
00:00:07,115 --> 00:00:11,134
You'd pack very differently if you were going to Hawaii versus skiing in Aspen.

5
00:00:11,134 --> 00:00:13,500
Starting with the data is like trying to pack

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,454
your suitcase when you don't know where you're going or for how long.

7
00:00:16,454 --> 00:00:18,224
You're likely to pack the wrong thing,

8
00:00:18,225 --> 00:00:21,585
forget important items, over pack, under pack.

9
00:00:21,585 --> 00:00:23,950
You certainly could buy things when you get there, sure,

10
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:26,280
but it'll be more expensive and you might feel a little

11
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,490
silly in Aspen with just your flip-flops at a swimsuit.

12
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:33,810
The most important part here is to actively learn frequently,

13
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,565
not just once, not quarterly,

14
00:00:35,564 --> 00:00:37,259
not monthly but setting up

15
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:41,899
a dynamic active learning pipeline which is always benchmarking against

16
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:44,929
a gold standard and updating that gold standard

17
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:49,445
dynamically as the nature of the unstructured data changes in reality.

18
00:00:49,445 --> 00:00:53,929
As you can see, the robot here is going to make a decision once it's deployed,

19
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:56,509
if it's confident, if it's met your threshold,

20
00:00:56,509 --> 00:00:57,979
or if it's not confident.

21
00:00:57,979 --> 00:01:00,679
Typically, you'll need to have human in

22
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:04,459
the loop process to learn from and give that feedback back to

23
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:07,369
your model so it can continuously learn and improve

24
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:11,900
the scope of what it's confident in to improve your business outcomes.
