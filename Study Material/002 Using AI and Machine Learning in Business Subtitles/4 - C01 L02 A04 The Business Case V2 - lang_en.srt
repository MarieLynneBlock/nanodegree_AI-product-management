1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,195
So let's talk a little bit about making a business case.

2
00:00:04,195 --> 00:00:08,199
How do you know what a good problem is for AI?

3
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:10,149
How do you define that problem,

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,910
value it, gets stakeholder buy-in, and investment?

5
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:17,964
As an example, one of our clients is Adobe.

6
00:00:17,964 --> 00:00:20,829
One of Adobe's flagship offerings is Adobe Stock,

7
00:00:20,829 --> 00:00:24,054
a curated collection of high-quality stock imagery.

8
00:00:24,054 --> 00:00:27,100
The library itself is staggeringly large.

9
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,470
There's over a 120 million photos,

10
00:00:29,469 --> 00:00:31,660
diagrams, videos, and graphics.

11
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,435
There is an additional a 150,000 uploaded every day.

12
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,775
As a product manager for Adobe,

13
00:00:37,774 --> 00:00:40,329
they need to make all of these images findable to

14
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:44,030
their customers and have a delightful experience.

15
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:49,314
Let's get in the mindset of a customer of Adobe's.

16
00:00:49,314 --> 00:00:51,979
Typically, their clients are looking for a piece of

17
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:56,679
specific visual content for perhaps a marketing campaign or a product launch.

18
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:00,740
They may have an aesthetic perspective in mind and they need to

19
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:05,030
find that one in a 120 million images like a needle in a haystack.

20
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,314
They couldn't possibly look through all a 120 million.

21
00:01:08,314 --> 00:01:12,230
So Adobe can help them by classifying images into categories,

22
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,240
deploying visual search technology,

23
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:16,250
recommending images to them,

24
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,599
or suggesting similar images to ones I've seen before to

25
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:25,244
those clients based on perhaps past image purchases.

26
00:01:25,245 --> 00:01:30,005
The business problem here is find the right image fast for the customer.

27
00:01:30,004 --> 00:01:32,390
This helps you narrow the scope of the problem.

28
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:36,694
It's unlikely you want your product to address the entire scope of the job.

29
00:01:36,694 --> 00:01:37,969
So in this case,

30
00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:39,745
let's break down that job.

31
00:01:39,745 --> 00:01:43,670
Here, the customer of Adobe needs to find a stock photo for

32
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:48,064
our marketing collateral which is likely to drive improved conversion and sales.

33
00:01:48,064 --> 00:01:51,170
So what this person actually does and

34
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,230
whether or not they are conscious about all of these different steps,

35
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,890
as a product manager here,

36
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,114
it's important to write them all down and

37
00:01:58,114 --> 00:02:01,864
clarify exactly what each step is trying to accomplish.

38
00:02:01,864 --> 00:02:03,319
So in this case,

39
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:08,194
this client would gather examples of photos which historically had high conversion.

40
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:12,829
They also may gather examples of photos which have had lower conversions.

41
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,590
They are going to identify visual criteria that are

42
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:18,800
consistent with those high converting photos

43
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,265
and inconsistent with the low converting photos.

44
00:02:21,264 --> 00:02:25,039
They may then log onto Adobe Stock photo database.

45
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:26,840
They're going to generate a search query.

46
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,939
They're going to search for what they're looking for,

47
00:02:28,939 --> 00:02:31,639
and they're probably going to get lots of results.

48
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:34,369
This is the point where they may apply filters to narrow

49
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,370
those results or perhaps start scrolling through

50
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,590
pages and pages to identify

51
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:43,295
images with the corresponding visual aesthetic that they're looking for.

52
00:02:43,294 --> 00:02:46,204
They may then narrow it down to a couple options,

53
00:02:46,205 --> 00:02:49,610
evaluate pricing, and eventually purchase the image.

54
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,545
This is the job to get done.

55
00:02:51,544 --> 00:02:58,139
So let's think a little bit about where the user pain is most acute here in this flow.

56
00:02:58,689 --> 00:03:01,354
We're going to take a quiz here.

57
00:03:01,354 --> 00:03:04,054
Which sequential steps could use

58
00:03:04,055 --> 00:03:08,525
machine learning computer vision technology to accomplish this task?

59
00:03:08,525 --> 00:03:11,694
One through three, two through five,

60
00:03:11,694 --> 00:03:15,489
five through eight, or seven through 10.
