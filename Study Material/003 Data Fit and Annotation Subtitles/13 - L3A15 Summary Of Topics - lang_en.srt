00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,970
You've learned a lot in this lesson and I wanted to do a quick recap.

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,980
First, we talked about how the data really

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,740
defines what patterns in machine learning model can learn.

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,630
So how complete the data is,

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,605
and how well it fits your business use case can really affect the accuracy of the model.

6
00:00:13,605 --> 00:00:18,329
Then we talked about methods for creating a dataset and annotating existing data.

7
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:21,929
Specifically, how you can design a data annotation job that includes

8
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:25,800
clear instructions for human annotators and examples of each datatype.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,769
Finally, something to keep in mind is updating your model

10
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:32,070
as needed in response to changes in the underlying data.

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,500
You should always keep your user front of mind and

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,155
consider how you might improve the model over time.

13
00:00:37,155 --> 00:00:40,460
This information is really useful for a variety of products,

14
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,740
and the ability to create a new data set is something

15
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,560
you'll need if you're creating a new product or application.

16
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,550
Next you'll get a chance to apply what you've learned in a data annotation project.
