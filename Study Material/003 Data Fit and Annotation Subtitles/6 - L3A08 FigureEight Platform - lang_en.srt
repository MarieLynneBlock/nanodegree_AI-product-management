1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,889
So when you go to the figure eight platform,

2
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:03,960
you'll be taken to our template library,

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,644
where all of our use cases are broken down

4
00:00:06,644 --> 00:00:10,004
such as sentiment analysis, search relevance etc.

5
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:13,589
We're going to go into image annotation and in here,

6
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:18,059
we have several different job types mostly tailored to actually annotating images.

7
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:20,584
So placing bounding boxes around items,

8
00:00:20,585 --> 00:00:24,164
using polygon tools outline objects etc.

9
00:00:24,164 --> 00:00:27,304
We'll go down to the image categorization.

10
00:00:27,304 --> 00:00:30,019
So we can preview this template in the platform

11
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:33,604
here and we can see that there's a set of instructions.

12
00:00:33,604 --> 00:00:37,804
In this case, we're categorizing whether an image includes animals.

13
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:41,884
What kind of animal it is and if there is another type of animal what that would be.

14
00:00:41,884 --> 00:00:43,394
So we have examples,

15
00:00:43,395 --> 00:00:45,200
how they should be categorized,

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,880
and then further down,

17
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,950
we can see the job design itself.

18
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,359
This is interactive.

19
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:52,250
So we can click each of

20
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,835
the options and see all the different types of elements that pop up.

21
00:00:55,835 --> 00:00:58,100
So we know that this will work for our use case.

22
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,600
Let's go ahead and use this template.
