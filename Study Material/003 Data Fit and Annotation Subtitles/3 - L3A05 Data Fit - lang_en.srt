1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,254
Your data should also represent the problem you're trying to solve.

2
00:00:03,254 --> 00:00:05,685
It should fit your particular use case.

3
00:00:05,684 --> 00:00:09,269
You can't train a production model off of artificial data.

4
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:13,814
You need to use production data to ensure training data matches real-world scenarios.

5
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:16,259
You also need to determine the success criteria

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,645
for the model which is typically based on precision,

7
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:20,535
recall, and the F1 score.

8
00:00:20,535 --> 00:00:23,460
If you determine that your model has not met these criteria,

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,740
you'll need to go back to the data and retrain.

10
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:27,989
This could entail including more edge cases,

11
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:30,929
more instances of classes where the model performed poorly,

12
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:33,869
or clearing up any ambiguity among classes.

13
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:36,809
A confusion matrix helps you understand the precision and

14
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,870
recall of your model by counting out the true and false positives,

15
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:42,314
as well as the true and false negatives.

16
00:00:42,314 --> 00:00:47,265
Precision indicates how often the models correct when it predicts the positive label.

17
00:00:47,265 --> 00:00:51,355
The formula is true positives over total predicted positives.

18
00:00:51,354 --> 00:00:53,034
So in this example,

19
00:00:53,034 --> 00:01:00,474
that would be 45 over 60 for a precision score of 75 percent.

20
00:01:00,475 --> 00:01:04,689
Recall indicates how many of the true positives your model predicted.

21
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:09,024
The formula is true positives over total actual positives.

22
00:01:09,025 --> 00:01:14,844
So here that's 45 out of 50 for a score of 90 percent for a recall.

23
00:01:14,844 --> 00:01:19,060
The F1 score is essentially a combination of precision and recall.

24
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,810
Because there are often trade-offs and aiming for higher precision or higher recall,

25
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:25,820
you can aim to increase the F1 score.
