Hi, my name is Carsten Gaki and I'm a product manager at Figure Eight.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,730
Where I work with a team that builds products to solve

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,315
data labeling problems frequently encountered in the machine learning space.

4
00:00:09,314 --> 00:00:12,209
In this lesson, I'll be discussing the importance of data and machine

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,420
learning and how to create a high-quality training data-set.

6
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:18,929
In the last lesson, you learned that a good Product Manager will know a lot

7
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:22,515
about their product and how it might be improved with machine learning techniques.

8
00:00:22,515 --> 00:00:26,339
Machine learning relies on having a relevant and large enough data source.

9
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:29,489
So, how do we go about answering questions using data?

10
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:31,349
Say you're a Product Manager for

11
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:34,605
an online retailer and you're tasked with improving search results.

12
00:00:34,604 --> 00:00:36,389
What exactly does that mean?

13
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,619
Well, it could mean that if a user searches for a pair of pants,

14
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:41,539
they always get back irrelevant result.

15
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:43,954
One that matches their query closely.

16
00:00:43,954 --> 00:00:47,494
It could also mean that this experience is tailored to a user.

17
00:00:47,494 --> 00:00:50,209
If they're told you something about their preferred style or fit,

18
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,745
you could show those kinds of pant options early on.

19
00:00:52,744 --> 00:00:56,729
This idea may be more promising but it's also more difficult in certain cases.

20
00:00:56,729 --> 00:01:00,024
Like if someone's a new user and you don't yet know their preferences.

21
00:01:00,024 --> 00:01:02,914
You need data to make both of these improvements work.

22
00:01:02,914 --> 00:01:06,739
In the first case, you'll need data about the relevancy of certain search items,

23
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:10,564
and in the second case you'll need data about individual preference.

24
00:01:10,564 --> 00:01:13,399
When you start to narrow down a business question like this,

25
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,800
you intuitively start thinking about what information

26
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:19,034
will actually be most useful in solving this task.

27
00:01:19,034 --> 00:01:21,409
In this lesson, we'll discuss how you can build

28
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:23,569
a data-set with the business problem in mind.

29
00:01:23,569 --> 00:01:25,569
We'll address identifying data fit,

30
00:01:25,569 --> 00:01:28,069
and how well a data-set matches a problem,

31
00:01:28,069 --> 00:01:31,159
determining whether a data-set is complete and if it contains

32
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:34,778
enough information to represent all real world use cases,

33
00:01:34,778 --> 00:01:38,989
and finally, we'll spend the bulk of this lesson discussing methods for data labeling,

34
00:01:38,989 --> 00:01:40,834
also known as data annotation.

35
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:43,729
Specifically we'll go over an example of building a data-set for

36
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:48,125
traffic sign classification using figure eights data annotation platform.

37
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:51,079
At each of these steps will also address strategies for

38
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:54,500
ensuring the quality of your data and the user experience over time.

39
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,230
By the end of this lesson, you should have all the information you

40
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,750
need to complete a data annotation project of your own.
