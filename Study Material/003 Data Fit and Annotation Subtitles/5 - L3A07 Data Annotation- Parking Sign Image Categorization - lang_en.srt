1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,590
In order to train your model,

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:03,060
you'll need annotated data.

3
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,950
Whether that means categorizing text,

4
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,540
outlining objects and images,

5
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,984
or any number of labeling requirements.

6
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:12,269
For this, you might choose a data labeling platform like Figure Eight.

7
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:14,070
This requires a few steps,

8
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,890
uploading data, designing a job,

9
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,760
creating test questions, launching and monitoring results,

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,700
and we'll go over each of these steps in more detail soon.

11
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:26,189
It's easiest to learn these steps in an example,

12
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,359
and I'll show you how we at Figure Eight annotated a dataset of parking sign images.

13
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,945
Here's what an image from this dataset looks like.

14
00:00:32,945 --> 00:00:35,179
These are images taken around San Francisco,

15
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:37,519
and the aim of this project was to identify the signs

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,175
as distinct from the background and other objects.

17
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:42,469
A later project may be able to actually read and

18
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:44,750
identify the different types of signs, but for now,

19
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,604
we want to take a bunch of images from around San Francisco and label them as containing,

20
00:00:48,604 --> 00:00:50,074
or not containing a sign.

21
00:00:50,075 --> 00:00:54,545
A yes/no label. Next, I'll go over designing a data annotation job generally,

22
00:00:54,545 --> 00:00:57,420
and then using this parking sign data.
