1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,089
So real continuous data also changes all the time.

2
00:00:03,089 --> 00:00:06,644
So how can you plan for long-term success?

3
00:00:06,644 --> 00:00:09,240
If your dataset absolutely does not change,

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,640
then you can use a static model which is trained once

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,280
and used indefinitely until an update is required.

6
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:17,519
But if your data is ever evolving as many are,

7
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,850
you should use a dynamic model which is continuously trained on new data,

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,980
so it can keep learning from new input.

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,660
If your data does change frequently,

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,399
you may need to continue making changes to

11
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,089
your annotation job to reflect more relevant definitions or examples.

12
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:32,859
For example, if you built a clothing classifier,

13
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:34,979
imagine you trained it on pants, tops,

14
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:38,479
and dresses, but now you've started including jumpsuits in your dataset.

15
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:40,819
In each train the model on this new data point to

16
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,445
avoid jumpsuits being labeled as pants or dresses.

17
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:46,759
Or if your model is region-based and you want to expand,

18
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:49,609
you'll need to train it on entirely new data altogether.

19
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:54,783
For example, if we wanted to expand our San Francisco parking sign dataset into London,

20
00:00:54,783 --> 00:00:57,350
we'd need to train it all signs around London because they're

21
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:00,750
completely different from those seen in San Francisco.
