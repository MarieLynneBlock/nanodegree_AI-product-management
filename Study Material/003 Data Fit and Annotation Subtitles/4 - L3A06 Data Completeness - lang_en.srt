it needs to be complete.

00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,060
This means that as much as possible,

4
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:09,570
it needs to represent all scenarios that could come up in real-world data.

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,100

00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:28,929
a lot and get the best data to serve your use case.
