1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,660
How model performs depends heavily on the training data you give it.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:05,700
So say you have a business problem,

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,120
how can you use data to best set up a model for success?

4
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:12,299
One thing to think about is do you have enough data?

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,190
Many machine-learning algorithms need many examples of every different type of

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:20,450
data to be able to learn to distinguish between different classes and find patterns.

7
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:23,089
Imagine your aim is to train a machine learning model to

8
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:25,969
distinguish between positive and negative movie reviews.

9
00:00:25,969 --> 00:00:27,979
You'll need a lot of review data to be able to find

10
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,969
the specific words or phrases that can help you categorize any new review.

11
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:34,969
Just a few data points will not provide enough information,

12
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:38,585
it will build some bias and inaccuracy in your resulted model.

13
00:00:38,585 --> 00:00:43,410
More data gives a machine-learning algorithm more context and information to learn from.

14
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:46,909
A good data set that has many examples of the different classes of data.

15
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:49,819
In this case negative and positive movie reviews,

16
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,909
will help them model generalize better when faced with new user data.
