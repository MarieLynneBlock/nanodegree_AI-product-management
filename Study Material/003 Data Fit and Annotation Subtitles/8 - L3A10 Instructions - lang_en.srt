1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,899
So a good set of instructions will always include an overview,

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:08,970
the steps that contributors need to take to complete the job, rules, and tips.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,630
In here, you should really include what contributors are looking for.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,975
So in this case, we're looking for parking signs in San Francisco,

5
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,714
and then can include street cleaning,

6
00:00:17,714 --> 00:00:20,565
accessible parking, no stopping, etc.

7
00:00:20,565 --> 00:00:22,820
You should provide rules for each of these.

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,789
So if parking signs are partially observable,

9
00:00:25,789 --> 00:00:27,144
you should answer, yes.

10
00:00:27,144 --> 00:00:31,489
We do not want parking signs that are on garage doors, things like that.

11
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:34,189
You should also define what these parking signs look like.

12
00:00:34,189 --> 00:00:35,960
So in this case,

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,270
text is generally not sufficient.

14
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:43,625
So we have a table that includes a definition as well as an example of the sign.

15
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:46,863
So here's our tow-away parking signs,

16
00:00:46,863 --> 00:00:49,939
time limit parking signs, etc.

17
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:54,644
We also include further examples of images from the actual data set.

18
00:00:54,645 --> 00:00:59,015
We call out where the signs are to make it clear what we're looking for.

19
00:00:59,015 --> 00:01:01,100
So in some of these, it's pretty hard to see.

20
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,719
In this image in the top right,

21
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,969
we've got two parking signs in here.

22
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:07,539
So this case would be a yes.

23
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,400
We want to show where parking signs or obfuscated.

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,410
So this one is behind a little tree but

25
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:14,810
we still want to make sure that contributors catch that,

26
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,635
and we also want to include examples where there are no signs that we're looking for.

27
00:01:18,635 --> 00:01:23,615
So in this case, there are street signs but their speed limit, some warning sign.

28
00:01:23,614 --> 00:01:25,759
These don't include the parking signs we're looking for and

29
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,310
we want to make sure contributors are aware of that.

30
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:32,280
Some of these don't contain any relevant signs.
