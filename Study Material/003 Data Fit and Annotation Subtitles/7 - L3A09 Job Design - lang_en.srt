1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,029
So we're taken into the data page,

2
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:04,779
which is where we'll upload our source data.

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,000
While this is uploading, you'll see a little message in

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,490
the bottom that tells you how many units have been uploaded.

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,375
We can go ahead and start designing while we wait for the data to be imported.

6
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:21,929
So our column mapper allows us to pretty quickly

7
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:24,929
map our source data to the existing job designs.

8
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:28,719
So our image URL is already mapped in. This is perfect.

9
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:32,969
We can see this job has a lot going on in this design.

10
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:34,814
So this is built in CML,

11
00:00:34,814 --> 00:00:37,155
which stands for Custom Markup Language,

12
00:00:37,155 --> 00:00:39,495
which is an HTML based language.

13
00:00:39,494 --> 00:00:41,634
It's just specific to figure eight.

14
00:00:41,634 --> 00:00:46,070
So CML is basically creating the elements that your contributors,

15
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,350
so the people working in your job will see.

16
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:52,020
So if we go down and take a look at preview,

17
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:58,140
we can see that our CML for radio has created a radio element.

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,350
Because I mapped our data into this job,

19
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:05,460
our new San Francisco data is showing here instead of animal images.

20
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:13,759
So, I'm going to go into a job that was already run using the Parking Sign Data.

21
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,250
If we go to this design page,

22
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,170
we can see the design is much simpler,

23
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,585
because we're only asking one question.

24
00:01:20,584 --> 00:01:24,329
So we'll take a look at the preview for this.
