1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
Once we have our instructions created,

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,230
which will be an iterative process as you go through your data and find more edge cases,

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,345
we can go into the quality.

4
00:00:09,345 --> 00:00:12,269
So you want us to create a set of test questions

5
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:15,000
for your job which is essentially ground truth data.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,670
It's where you provide an answer to the question,

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,000
and the contributor is working in the job are tested on these answers,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,984
both before entering and while they continue to work.

9
00:00:23,984 --> 00:00:26,219
This ensures that they understand what they're doing,

10
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:29,009
it ensures that their accuracy keeps up.

11
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,789
If they ever fall below the accuracy threshold that you set,

12
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:34,409
they get removed from the job.

13
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,989
So we'll go into the quality page,

14
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,060
we will create a new test question,

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,660
click out of these messages.

16
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:48,379
So in this job in this particular image,

17
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,090
we can see that there are no parking signs,

18
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,770
so we would want to select no.

19
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,465
We also want to include a reason.

20
00:00:53,465 --> 00:00:55,700
So when a contributor misses a test question,

21
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,520
they are shown the correct answer after they submit,

22
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,175
along with a reason for why they were incorrect.

23
00:01:01,174 --> 00:01:03,679
So in this case, the answer is no,

24
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,555
we'll say this image only contains houses.

25
00:01:08,555 --> 00:01:12,320
So this is a chance for you to train the contributors while they're working.

26
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:13,729
If you don't include a reason,

27
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,859
they won't necessarily understand why they were wrong,

28
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:21,200
and it doesn't help them learn to look out for what they missed previously.

29
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,820
So we'll go ahead and save this.

30
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,180
So one thing to note about test questions is you do

31
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,285
want to make sure you have a pretty even answer distribution.

32
00:01:32,284 --> 00:01:34,325
So if we take a look here,

33
00:01:34,325 --> 00:01:37,165
we've got about 59 percent no.

34
00:01:37,165 --> 00:01:39,390
Because we only have two answer options,

35
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,825
we can choose to make this closer to 50/50.

36
00:01:41,825 --> 00:01:44,000
This is to ensure a couple of things.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,239
So one, we want to make sure that

38
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,954
you're testing contributors on all possible answer types,

39
00:01:49,954 --> 00:01:54,170
and you're not training them to lean more towards no,

40
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,519
there's no parking sign.

41
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:00,129
So you want to train them to look out for everything that might appear in your dataset.

42
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:04,670
This is also to ensure quality from contributors.

43
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,370
Let's say you had a 90 percent no,

44
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,439
that would really allow people to just select

45
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:12,780
no every time and continue to work in the job.

46
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,210
Once you have enough test questions created,

47
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,040
you can go ahead and launch the job.

48
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,715
We always recommend launching just a subset of the data,

49
00:02:22,715 --> 00:02:24,770
this is to ensure you don't launch

50
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,180
your entire job and then realize that something was wrong with your instructions,

51
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,295
or your test questions, or the design, or the data itself.

52
00:02:31,294 --> 00:02:34,639
So you should default to launching a 100 rows

53
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,014
to begin with and as the job is running, you can monitor.

54
00:02:38,014 --> 00:02:42,209
So this job is already been launched so we'll take a look at the monitor page.

55
00:02:43,909 --> 00:02:49,034
We can see high-level numbers here for how the job ran,

56
00:02:49,034 --> 00:02:52,609
we can see how many contributors failed out of quiz mode.

57
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:57,450
While the job is running, you should also go back and look at your test questions.

58
00:02:57,949 --> 00:03:00,733
So going back into quality,

59
00:03:00,734 --> 00:03:04,585
it helps to take a look at the most highly missed questions,

60
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:07,469
and see where contributors are misunderstanding the job.

61
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:12,050
So again, this is another opportunity for you to identify what's going

62
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,180
wrong in the job and where you may need to

63
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,435
augment the instructions or include more examples,

64
00:03:17,435 --> 00:03:20,224
or maybe you need to redesign your job.

65
00:03:20,224 --> 00:03:22,905
Something could have gone terribly wrong.

66
00:03:22,905 --> 00:03:25,289
So in this case,

67
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:26,629
we said the answer is yes,

68
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:27,979
there's a parking sign in this image,

69
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:31,099
but 86 percent of contributors were wrong.

70
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:33,889
So we can see based on our reason,

71
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:36,724
that there's no parking sign on the left side.

72
00:03:36,724 --> 00:03:38,900
So we can see up here,

73
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,539
in the middle like center left,

74
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:42,634
there is a no parking sign,

75
00:03:42,634 --> 00:03:44,689
we want to make sure contributors notice that.

76
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:45,949
It is really small,

77
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:47,149
it is easy to miss,

78
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,490
but we want to make sure our model can

79
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:53,020
understand there are signs in this image, we want to catch this.

80
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,140
So what the contributors miss,

81
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:56,544
your model may also miss.

82
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:00,469
So this would be an opportunity for us to potentially even take this particular image,

83
00:04:00,469 --> 00:04:03,264
and bring it into the instructions as an example,

84
00:04:03,264 --> 00:04:06,809
which again is why instructions are an iterative process.

85
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,930
You may find you only covered

86
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:13,230
simpler cases and you want to go back and include more difficult ones.
