1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,470
Once your job is complete,

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:03,179
you can download the results,

3
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,235
over in the results page,

4
00:00:05,235 --> 00:00:08,400
and you should absolutely audit the results of your job.

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,794
So this is very similar in essence to auditing test questions.

6
00:00:12,794 --> 00:00:17,100
This gives you a chance to identify where contributors misunderstood the job.

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,215
Go back update the instructions,

8
00:00:19,214 --> 00:00:21,975
update the design, create more test questions.

9
00:00:21,975 --> 00:00:26,880
Then you can launch either another test or you might find that your job design was great,

10
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:29,564
and you got the quality you wanted on the first try.

11
00:00:29,565 --> 00:00:32,800
You could go back and launch the remainder of your data.
