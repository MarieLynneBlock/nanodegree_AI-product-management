1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,944
So you may not be able to train your model on all the possible data points.

2
00:00:03,944 --> 00:00:05,609
In our case, it was pretty simple.

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:10,275
It was a yes/no. But you will sometimes need to design for unknown cases.

4
00:00:10,275 --> 00:00:11,759
In terms of a job design,

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,949
this could be handled by including an unknown or

6
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:16,724
an unable to answer option among the labels.

7
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:20,520
You should design for the outcome with the least negative impact.

8
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:22,949
So if we take a look at this sign over here,

9
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:26,730
this would be safest to say that this is a no parking sign.

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,769
We want to decrease the chances of someone getting

11
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:32,250
a parking ticket and because this is such a confusing image,

12
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,515
it is best to say no parking

13
00:00:34,515 --> 00:00:35,969
regardless of whether there are

14
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,250
three hours in the day that you might be able to park there.
