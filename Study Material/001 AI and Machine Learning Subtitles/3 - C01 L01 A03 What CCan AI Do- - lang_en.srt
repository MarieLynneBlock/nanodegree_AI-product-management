00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,754
So let's go into a couple of different examples of AI technology actually applied.

2
00:00:04,754 --> 00:00:08,625
Facial recognition is an easy example that comes up all the time.

3
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:12,330
It's now at near human or better than human level performance

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:13,830
depending on the context.

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,789
Anyone who uses Facebook can tell you that lots of AI

6
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:19,859
is used to recognize faces,

7
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:22,980
and it can sometimes go overboard into

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,640
an interaction that maybe make people feel uncomfortable.

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,750
Computers can easily recognize individual people along with emotion,

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,090
and even micro-expressions that you might not be

11
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,100
aware of that you're having yourself.

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,340
Another example that I use all the time when I'm traveling on

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,870
business is automatic text recognition.

14
00:00:41,869 --> 00:00:43,219
So if you're traveling on business,

15
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:47,829
you might take pictures of your receipts to automate your expense reporting.

16
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:51,320
What the computer vision is actually doing is finding

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,704
where the amount is on the receipt.

18
00:00:53,704 --> 00:00:56,269
Transcribing that amount, transcribing the date and

19
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,400
any other relevant information of

20
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:04,144
the receipt to help facilitate and make expense reporting way easier.

21
00:01:04,144 --> 00:01:06,799
Before I started using this technology,

22
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,379
it would take me a couple hours at the end of

23
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:12,744
the week to categorize all of my receipts and do my expenses.

24
00:01:12,745 --> 00:01:15,469
Now I don't even set aside time anymore because on

25
00:01:15,469 --> 00:01:19,450
the go I simply take a picture and it automatically works for me.

26
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:24,590
Even more granularly, this is an example where computer vision

27
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,484
technology using semantic segmentation can take

28
00:01:27,484 --> 00:01:32,810
every single pixel in an image and assign it to a particular object,

29
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,390
way more granular than just bounding boxes.

30
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:42,500
You can say this pixel is belonging to this object which is identified as a person,

31
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,844
car, or a road.

32
00:01:44,844 --> 00:01:48,650
Imagenet is a prestigious computer vision contests

33
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,070
where teams compete to recognize objects and images.

34
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:56,344
Shown here is the top five error rate,

35
00:01:56,344 --> 00:02:01,609
and over the last ten years you can see that computer vision has gotten

36
00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:09,500
way better and actually getting better than humans over classifying images.

37
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,134
You can see the difference in older techniques,

38
00:02:12,134 --> 00:02:17,609
and newer deep learning techniques which are driving the improvements here.

39
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,588
From an application perspective,

40
00:02:20,588 --> 00:02:24,229
you may use a computer vision in a social media use case.

41
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:26,629
This is really common with big brands.

42
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:28,549
They want to understand ''hey,

43
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,860
where is my brand being talked about online?''

44
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,770
You can't simply do keyword matching and search

45
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:36,920
for you Udacity and how often that comes up on Twitter.

46
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:39,199
You might need to understand,

47
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:44,839
hey this is a picture of my logo or my brand that is being talked about,

48
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,319
and take the corresponding texts and do sentiment analysis and

49
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,719
natural language processing to understand whether or

50
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:53,210
not someone saying something nice about this class,

51
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:56,700
or something perhaps a little more constructive.

52
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:02,180
Similarly, speech recognition has had the same set of

53
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,730
step function improvements which have led to products

54
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:07,054
like Amazon echo or Siri.

55
00:03:07,055 --> 00:03:10,025
I argue with my Amazon echo all the time.

56
00:03:10,025 --> 00:03:11,520
My husband has installed,

57
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,439
I think we have three or four echoes in our house.

58
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,564
However, unfortunately Alexa doesn't recognize me all the time.

59
00:03:19,564 --> 00:03:22,699
It's because speech recognition is not quite there in

60
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:26,000
terms of human level computation in real-world environments.

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,139
If you've ever been in a noisy restaurant,

62
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:30,289
you can understand some of these difficulties.

63
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:31,579
So if you're in a noisy place,

64
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:35,630
what your brain actually does is it tunes out the ambient noise

65
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:38,030
around you and it tunes in to what the person across

66
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,125
the table is actually saying to you,

67
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:43,879
and this is something that is really difficult to teach a computer

68
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:45,215
to do the same thing.

69
00:03:45,215 --> 00:03:48,020
There's been drastic improvements in the last five years,

70
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,480
but speech recognition is still really tricky.

71
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:53,719
If you perhaps speak English as not your first language

72
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:57,139
or you have an accent from the South or New York,

73
00:03:57,139 --> 00:04:00,859
or perhaps a different dialect or speaking style where

74
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:05,030
the system hasn't had as much exposure and hasn't been trained on that,

75
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:08,219
it can make the error rates really high.

76
00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:11,794
Another example, there's all different types of

77
00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:15,094
audio recognition not just transcribing speech.

78
00:04:15,094 --> 00:04:18,439
But it could also be around recognizing mechanical

79
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:20,569
failures by listening to engines.

80
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:24,034
As you can see, here's what's working or what's not working.

81
00:04:24,035 --> 00:04:27,439
Natural language processing is yet another area

82
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,154
that has made huge advances in the last five years.

83
00:04:30,154 --> 00:04:32,734
It doesn't demo quite as nicely as computer vision,

84
00:04:32,735 --> 00:04:34,189
but it's just as interesting.

85
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:37,160
Techniques such as filtering out hate speech in

86
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,905
social media platforms or perhaps when you're reading the New York Times,

87
00:04:40,904 --> 00:04:42,653
and you're looking through the comments,

88
00:04:42,653 --> 00:04:46,045
and there's no foul words there,

89
00:04:46,045 --> 00:04:50,900
or it's making a recommendation based on what stock to buy based on

90
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:53,209
what companies are being talked about in positive

91
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,924
or negative sentiments online.

92
00:04:55,925 --> 00:04:58,520
Here you can see as an example of textile,

93
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:03,500
which is an AI technology that gives advice on the quality of your writing,

94
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,629
and how good it is as you're writing it.

95
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:08,180
I wish I had this in high school.
