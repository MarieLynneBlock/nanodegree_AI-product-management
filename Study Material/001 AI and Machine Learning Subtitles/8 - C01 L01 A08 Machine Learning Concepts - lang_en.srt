1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,730
So now we're going to take a little bit of

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,820
a deeper dive into machine learning specifically.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,054
So what is machine learning?

4
00:00:08,054 --> 00:00:11,564
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence,

5
00:00:11,564 --> 00:00:15,299
as simply put by Tom Mitchell,

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,484
Professor and Former Chair of the Machine-Learning Department

7
00:00:18,484 --> 00:00:19,544
at Carnegie Mellon.

8
00:00:19,545 --> 00:00:24,450
Computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience,

9
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:26,024
pretty simple.

10
00:00:26,024 --> 00:00:30,140
We're going to go over three major sections of machine-learning

11
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,475
and different techniques.

12
00:00:31,475 --> 00:00:35,899
Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

13
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:39,649
Supervised learning uses pre-labeled data to train a model to

14
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:43,864
predict new outcomes for information that hasn't been exposed to before.

15
00:00:43,865 --> 00:00:47,660
Unsupervised learning uses non-labeled data and self

16
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:52,339
organizes to predict patterns or outcomes such as clustering or associations.

17
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,790
Reinforcement learning is giving feedback to an algorithm when

18
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:59,149
it does something right or wrong based on a discrete outcome,

19
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:02,670
this can either be in real time or offline.
