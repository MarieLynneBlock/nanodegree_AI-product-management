1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
So I want to shift gears a little bit and talk about industry applications of AI,

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,635
and what I'm seeing actual businesses and customers use this every day.

3
00:00:10,634 --> 00:00:14,955
So Andrew Ng says that AI is the new electricity.

4
00:00:14,955 --> 00:00:17,115
It's something I really subscribed to.

5
00:00:17,114 --> 00:00:20,219
A hundred years ago we didn't have access to electricity,

6
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:22,799
and it transformed every major industry,

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,410
and it was impossible to really predict ahead of

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,740
time how that transformation what's going to happen,

9
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:30,549
or what the outcomes were going to be, right?

10
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,780
So in agriculture suddenly you had refrigeration techniques,

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,100
so you could move food around.

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,920
In communication, suddenly you had the telegraph,

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,730
so you we're no longer using mail, then the Internet.

14
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:44,579
Manufacturing ray, you created the electric motor,

15
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,524
it really just transformed every single industry.

16
00:00:48,524 --> 00:00:53,820
Similarly there are applications across every industry in AI.

17
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:59,364
A study by PWC projects that by 2030,

18
00:00:59,365 --> 00:01:05,090
there's going to be $15.7 trillion added to the global economy,

19
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,650
and a lot of that's going to come from

20
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,920
labor productivity improvements, and product enhancements.

21
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:17,689
A couple sectors that I see today having huge strides in AI,

22
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:19,939
very commonly is e-commerce.

23
00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:23,734
Often this comes down to pricing and promotions,

24
00:01:23,734 --> 00:01:29,329
customer service management such as helping to reduce the time that

25
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:35,000
it may take to get a response from a customer service department such as password reset,

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,454
or can you help me refine my serial number?

27
00:01:38,454 --> 00:01:42,019
In consumer goods, a lot of innovation going

28
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:46,219
into supply chain management or demand forecasting.

29
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:49,549
Being able to route goods and services to

30
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:52,879
where customers are most likely to purchase them.

31
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,524
Even in finance around marketing and sales,

32
00:01:56,524 --> 00:02:01,739
how do I know when perhaps someone is likely to get married or have a baby.

33
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:04,009
I may want to sell them different insurance,

34
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:07,980
or manage risks differently with that particular customer.
