00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,569
Another category of unsupervised learning is around reinforcement learning,

2
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:05,669
which is an area of machine-learning concerned with

3
00:00:05,669 --> 00:00:07,830
how machine learning agents

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:13,125
ought to take action in an environment so as to maximize a specific outcome.

5
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:16,155
So you may be familiar with

6
00:00:16,155 --> 00:00:18,900
an example such as the chat bar that was put up

7
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:20,820
by Microsoft a couple years ago,

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,629
where it was an agent that was learning about

9
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:26,969
and having conversations with the public.

10
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:30,059
It didn't go so well because what happened was,

11
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:33,449
the public actually trained it in a situation that was less than

12
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,710
favorable and ended

13
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,380
up sort of learning a lot racists and unsavory techniques.

14
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,340
So reinforcement learning is really, really powerful.

15
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,359
When it actually takes those actions from an environment in that reward,

16
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,089
and it's interpreted and fed back into the agent to

17
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,210
learn about the environment and continuously make decisions.

18
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:59,420
If you don't have a human in the loop in reinforcement learning

19
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,480
to deploy the production,

20
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:03,739
it can be really scary and often

21
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:08,030
unwise to deploy that without some sort of manual intervention.

22
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,219
An example of reinforcement learning

23
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:14,420
here that I used a lot to explain it's like a two-year-old.

24
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:18,140
So when you are teaching a two-year-old about different animals,

25
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,010
and you're like,

26
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,859
hey this is a cat and this is a dog and this is a cow,

27
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:24,189
and they may have a picture book in front of them.

28
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:27,409
Then you'd get them out to an actual barnyard and they see a cow

29
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:28,219
for the first time,

30
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:31,769
they may look at you quizzically and be like cow,

31
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:34,350
and you're going to as the parents reinforce that,

32
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:36,539
you're going to say, "Yeah, honey that's a cow."

33
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,760
That reinforces it for that child,

34
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,650
and they learn what a cow is.
