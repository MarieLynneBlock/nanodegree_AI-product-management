1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,649
So we're going to switch gears a little bit

2
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:03,960
and talk about current state of the art AI,

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,464
and what's actually being used in reality.

4
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:10,605
So right now, AI can do specific,

5
00:00:10,605 --> 00:00:16,394
narrow tasks pretty well that learn from large volumes of unstructured data.

6
00:00:16,394 --> 00:00:19,350
These can sometimes be referred to as

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,080
first generation AI applications that are referring

8
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:25,859
to as artificial narrow intelligence.

9
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,695
These systems are all over the place in our daily lives.

10
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:32,799
They enable Facebook to recognize our faces and images, they tag users,

11
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,449
it's what Siri uses to understand your voice and act accordingly,

12
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,140
or enable Google to find the search results you're looking for.

13
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,340
But each of those tasks is narrow and discrete.

14
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,890
So there's certain things that AI can do really

15
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,280
well right now or better than even the best human.

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,320
There's achieve superhuman performance in mostly game play.

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,700
Again, limited to narrow and specific tasks.

18
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:06,450
Similarly to humans, AI can be really good at classifying images,

19
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,850
as we mentioned, handwriting recognitions or facial recognitions.

20
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:15,479
However, AI is really bad when you start

21
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,695
asking if to do anything outside of what it's been trained on.

22
00:01:18,694 --> 00:01:24,679
So if you took an incredibly efficient image classification model and you said,

23
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,640
"Instead of just classifying inside or outside,

24
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,879
can you actually put a caption and describe what's going on

25
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:35,349
in this image of children in the forests playing with ball?"

26
00:01:35,349 --> 00:01:37,754
It would probably fall apart.

27
00:01:37,754 --> 00:01:42,859
AI is pretty bad at doing more complex tasks

28
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:48,590
such as anything that requires contextual knowledge or explainability.

29
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,620
Machine translation gets really stuck or

30
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:54,740
as I was mentioned before, general speech recognition.

31
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:57,140
It can do it really well and narrow,

32
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:03,094
and specific environmental settings often in limited cases better than humans.

33
00:02:03,094 --> 00:02:05,679
But when you're trying to generalize something,

34
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,575
AI is very brittle.

35
00:02:07,575 --> 00:02:10,295
Self-driving cars, good example.

36
00:02:10,294 --> 00:02:12,109
If there were no humans on the road,

37
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,270
there'll be self-driving cars all over the place today.

38
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:19,759
But we haven't quite bridged the gap here dealing

39
00:02:19,758 --> 00:02:26,459
with nuanced situations and complex unpredictable situations,

40
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:32,150
which humans are all the time of self-driving cars or even translation.

41
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:36,800
As you can see, if you're translating something from English to French,

42
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,620
this program fell into the trap.

43
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,340
Not realizing that as any human reader would that I was describing a couple.

44
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,259
Stressing that for each item,

45
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:48,064
he had, she had a similar one.

46
00:02:48,064 --> 00:02:51,020
For example, the deep learning engine that used the word SA

47
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,030
for both his car and her car.

48
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,935
So you can't tell anything about either car owners gender.

49
00:02:56,935 --> 00:03:00,289
The human-translated French version is

50
00:03:00,289 --> 00:03:04,169
quite different from the machine-translated version.

51
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:09,170
Sebastian Thrun, as we are at the brink of being able to take AI,

52
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:11,179
have it, look over our shoulders,

53
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,730
and then it will make us maybe 10 or 50 times

54
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:16,829
as effective as these repetitive things.
