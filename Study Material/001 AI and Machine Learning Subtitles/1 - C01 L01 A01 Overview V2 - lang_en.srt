00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,359
Welcome to AI for product managers.

2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:07,439
In this nano-degree, you'll learn about how to build products that leverage AI.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,405
I'm Alyssa Simpson Rohwerger.

4
00:00:09,404 --> 00:00:11,625
Thanks so much for joining me for this lesson.

5
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:14,279
I've had the privilege to be doing product management for

6
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:17,219
close to 10 years building data intensive products.

7
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:20,894
The last four years of which I've been using machine learning technology.

8
00:00:20,894 --> 00:00:24,225
I'm currently VP of product at Figure Eight, an apping company.

9
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:27,240
Figure Eight combines human and machine intelligence to provide

10
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:30,029
high-quality annotated training data that powers

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,289
the world's most sophisticated and innovative machine-learning and business solutions.

12
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:38,479
Previously I was a customer at IBM Watson as director of

13
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:40,339
product management for a portfolio of

14
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,565
different machine learning products that included computer vision,

15
00:00:43,564 --> 00:00:47,134
speech, machine translation, sentiment analysis.

16
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:52,414
Let's get started. What we're going to cover in today's lesson is an overview of AI.

17
00:00:52,414 --> 00:00:54,655
How that's different from machine-learning.

18
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:58,130
Cover some terms like neural network and deep learning as

19
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,865
well as a little bit around what the current state of the art is in AI.

20
00:01:01,865 --> 00:01:06,140
I'm really excited about AI technology because generally speaking,

21
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,340
I believe it has the potential to rapidly change our world for the better,

22
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,445
helping people improve outcomes across industries.

23
00:01:13,444 --> 00:01:17,989
Some of this I get to see every single day and it's really cool.

24
00:01:17,989 --> 00:01:21,739
Everything from improving outcomes for patients,

25
00:01:21,739 --> 00:01:27,379
to being able to scale customer service and have people be far less frustrated,

26
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:32,519
to reducing drought and water usage here in California.
