1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,754
So 50 years ago,

2
00:00:01,754 --> 00:00:07,064
AI was used to describe transformational technologies like a calculator.

3
00:00:07,065 --> 00:00:09,900
Today, it might be sort of hard pressed to find

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,470
anyone who thinks a calculator is a great example of AI.

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,365
However, what's most important to take away is that this

6
00:00:16,364 --> 00:00:19,754
continues to change as the technology changes.

7
00:00:19,754 --> 00:00:22,859
So machine learning is a term that applies to algorithms

8
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,614
which can learn from data.

9
00:00:24,614 --> 00:00:28,189
Typically speaking today that often references

10
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:32,120
supervised learning techniques where humans actually massage the data,

11
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:35,448
design different sort of representations or features of that data,

12
00:00:35,448 --> 00:00:36,725
and train a model.

13
00:00:36,725 --> 00:00:39,829
More recently deep learning is a subset of

14
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:43,909
machine learning in which there's multilayered of neural networks

15
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:45,259
that learned from very,

16
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:51,445
very large sets of data to predict outcomes from unstructured inputs.

17
00:00:51,445 --> 00:00:56,689
Generally speaking, AI integrates perception so understanding the world,

18
00:00:56,689 --> 00:01:00,859
predicting, reasoning, and decision-making around getting

19
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:02,464
to a particular outcome.

20
00:01:02,465 --> 00:01:06,695
So what do people mean when they refer to "AI'?

21
00:01:06,694 --> 00:01:09,229
The term AI is aspirational,

22
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,770
a moving target based on those capabilities that humans possess

23
00:01:12,769 --> 00:01:15,039
but machines do not.

24
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,829
These days when people say AI,

25
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:21,229
they often mean the most advanced machine-learning techniques

26
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,150
that are available today,

27
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,120
that may be deep learning but in a few weeks from now

28
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,180
or a few months from now that may be referencing something totally different.
