1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,310
Supervised learning is what most of machine learning and production

2
00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:12,024
today is actually using and it's mapping inputs to a particular output.

3
00:00:12,025 --> 00:00:13,300
So in this case,

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,550
the input is a picture of a mountain and the output is, mountain.

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,929
Very close to a 100 percent of actual production machine learning,

6
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:26,304
business technology is actually using supervised learning.

7
00:00:26,304 --> 00:00:30,429
So in a simple way supervised learning,

8
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:33,765
input image, output label.

9
00:00:33,765 --> 00:00:37,015
Person or not person, person.

10
00:00:37,015 --> 00:00:40,734
This is an example of classification which is categorizing

11
00:00:40,734 --> 00:00:45,554
unstructured data into particular categories or a class.

12
00:00:45,554 --> 00:00:47,744
You could also have multiple categories.

13
00:00:47,744 --> 00:00:49,159
For example in this case,

14
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:52,819
instead of just two classes of person or not person you could

15
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,155
have three categories which is person, plant, or neither.

16
00:00:57,155 --> 00:01:00,289
Another version of supervised learning is regression.

17
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:02,479
So the main difference between classification and

18
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,390
regression is that the output variable in

19
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,939
a regression is numerical or continuous

20
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:11,390
while classification it is categorical or discrete.

21
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,989
So in this case, you have input data which is homes

22
00:01:14,989 --> 00:01:18,609
and some information about the house, how big it was,

23
00:01:18,609 --> 00:01:20,174
how many bedrooms or bathrooms,

24
00:01:20,174 --> 00:01:25,259
and the output is a label which is the price for that home and what it sold for,

25
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:29,430
and so you can use this to do regression.

26
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:37,099
Most supervised learning use cases fall into these types of use cases.

27
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:40,759
So machine translation, we talked about audio transcription,

28
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,685
or event detection, sentiment analysis,

29
00:01:43,685 --> 00:01:47,210
optical character recognition, natural language processing.

30
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:49,939
There's all different types of supervised learning

31
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:54,599
that are deploying these techniques.
