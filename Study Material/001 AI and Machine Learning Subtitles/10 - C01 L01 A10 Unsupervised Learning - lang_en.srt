1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,379
On the other end of the spectrum,

2
00:00:01,379 --> 00:00:03,254
we have unsupervised learning.

3
00:00:03,254 --> 00:00:06,810
Unsupervised learning finds patterns in data.

4
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:11,369
Clustering is a good example here of unsupervised learning,

5
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:14,234
where the original data is all gray and

6
00:00:14,234 --> 00:00:18,105
unsupervised learning can cluster the data into three different sections.

7
00:00:18,105 --> 00:00:20,640
There are very few business applications of this,

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,399
but there's quite a few examples in

9
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:27,509
the media of unsupervised learning particularly in game play.

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,340
An unsupervised learning use case that may actually be deployed in

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,575
a business or production environment is around an e-commerce website.

12
00:00:36,575 --> 00:00:40,355
So if you have a static or fairly static e-commerce website

13
00:00:40,354 --> 00:00:42,199
and you're asking the question

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,900
what is a common customer journey or

15
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:48,048
path through the website that results in a high conversion,

16
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,685
you can look at the data.

17
00:00:49,685 --> 00:00:52,010
Using an unsupervised learning technique,

18
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:54,559
cluster the customer journey into

19
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,250
those different patterns or paths that customers take

20
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,840
to actually purchase something.

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,570
So it could be that people go to your product page,

22
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,439
and then they drill down into different collections or featured products.

23
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:09,739
Then, they add something to their cart and they go linearly

24
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:10,939
through this order summary,

25
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:12,530
and out to shipping.

26
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,140
Or, they may go to your homepage and have

27
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,870
a totally separate journey around managing their account.

28
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,900
These can be different clusters of

29
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,170
using unsupervised techniques that you can bubble these up

30
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,159
and learn about them.
