1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
So now, let's take a look at the term Neural Networks,

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,099
and what that actually means.

3
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:06,869
So we're going to take an example,

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,234
say you need to make a decision.

5
00:00:08,234 --> 00:00:11,294
Should I go to a work colleague's party?

6
00:00:11,294 --> 00:00:14,414
Neural networks could be deployed to help you make that decision.

7
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:19,244
So a neural network makes decisions based on weighing evidence.

8
00:00:19,245 --> 00:00:21,015
Inputs are yes-no questions.

9
00:00:21,015 --> 00:00:22,785
Output is a yes-no question.

10
00:00:22,785 --> 00:00:26,324
So you could have three inputs such as, am I free?

11
00:00:26,324 --> 00:00:27,824
Will it be fun?

12
00:00:27,824 --> 00:00:29,714
Is it near public transit?

13
00:00:29,714 --> 00:00:32,759
The outcome of those three questions gets you to

14
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,814
a more global decision output.

15
00:00:34,814 --> 00:00:37,210
Unfortunately, life's a little bit more complicated

16
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,664
and some things matter more than others.

17
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:43,759
So this is introducing the concept of weights and thresholds here.

18
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:46,519
So in this case, am I free?

19
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,830
If we've given that a weight of six,

20
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:53,960
and the threshold overall for making this decision is five or above.

21
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,314
It really only matters if you're free.

22
00:00:56,314 --> 00:00:57,679
Because, will it be fun?

23
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:59,219
Has a weight of two,

24
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:00,644
and is it near public transit?

25
00:01:00,645 --> 00:01:02,085
Also, has a weight of two.

26
00:01:02,085 --> 00:01:04,745
So basically, if you're free no matter what,

27
00:01:04,745 --> 00:01:06,635
you're going to go to the party.

28
00:01:06,635 --> 00:01:09,469
However, if you change the threshold to be

29
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:12,799
seven or you change some of the weights around,

30
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,689
multiple factors would contribute into whether or not you're free,

31
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:19,159
it also has to be fun,

32
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:20,974
or near public transit.

33
00:01:20,974 --> 00:01:22,819
What's really important here is that,

34
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:24,349
as a good product manager,

35
00:01:24,349 --> 00:01:26,809
you have to make sure that your data science team

36
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,055
or your machine learning team

37
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:32,600
really knows all of the data that's going to be critical for making this decision.

38
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:35,719
Are these three factors the only factors to consider?

39
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:38,060
Perhaps, you also might want to consider,

40
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,204
is my ex-boyfriend going to be at the party?

41
00:01:40,204 --> 00:01:42,745
Or is the food going to be worth it?

42
00:01:42,745 --> 00:01:45,050
In which case, you may have a different outcome.

43
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:48,200
Ensuring that these teams are working collaboratively with you and

44
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,320
have an awareness of all the important decision-making factors,

45
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:56,169
and criteria is really important on what makes a good model.

46
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,700
Models aren't good or bad,

47
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:02,210
they are just reflective of the inputs and decision-making criteria

48
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:03,184
that you give them.

49
00:02:03,185 --> 00:02:04,950
So we'll take that decision.

50
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,525
But if you're anything like me,

51
00:02:06,525 --> 00:02:09,110
it's actually you may sweat the decision a lot,

52
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:12,260
and weigh quite a few different factors on whether or not you want to

53
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:16,114
attend your colleague's party and make a more complex decision.

54
00:02:16,115 --> 00:02:21,425
So each layer makes decisions based on the decisions made in the prior layer.

55
00:02:21,425 --> 00:02:23,165
These are called deep neural networks.

56
00:02:23,164 --> 00:02:25,429
It's an artificial neural network with

57
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,849
multiple layers between the input and the output layers.

58
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:31,789
Often, there can be dozens, or hundreds,

59
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:38,465
even thousands of different layers between the input and the decision output.

60
00:02:38,465 --> 00:02:41,050
So let's shift gears a little bit,

61
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,600
and take an image recognition task here.

62
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:47,479
One of the things that you can use a neural net for is to do

63
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,769
character recognition.

64
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:53,325
In this case, recognize the input of a handwritten seven.

65
00:02:53,324 --> 00:02:54,909
Which in an image,

66
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:57,259
represents actually multiple pixels in

67
00:02:57,259 --> 00:03:02,914
a grayscale and each pixel has a value between zero and 255,

68
00:03:02,914 --> 00:03:10,759
and you need to understand the order and where those pixels are in an image.

69
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:15,590
So it actually has 784 different inputs here,

70
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,685
if this seven is drawn on a 28 by 28 scale.

71
00:03:19,685 --> 00:03:22,064
As you can see, one seven,

72
00:03:22,064 --> 00:03:29,375
784 inputs, and the inputs are each of the individual pixel values.

73
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,090
A deep neural network takes the input from each of

74
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:35,539
these pixels and makes a series of subsequent decisions,

75
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:39,349
so that the output of this neural network can recognize the number.

76
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:43,085
It's a seven. One output neuron for each digit.

77
00:03:43,085 --> 00:03:46,775
The neuron with the highest value is the predicted digit.

78
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:51,349
It could perhaps, also have an output that it's a one,

79
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:54,604
because they may look similarly depending on how it's drawn.

80
00:03:54,604 --> 00:03:59,959
But what it's going to give you is the confidence that it's most likely to be.

81
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,689
These neural networks are trained by a large amounts of

82
00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:04,715
paired input and output values.

83
00:04:04,715 --> 00:04:06,409
In this case, a lot of examples of

84
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:10,224
handwritten numbers categorized into which digit they're representing.

85
00:04:10,224 --> 00:04:12,989
You probably use this every day in reality,

86
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,360
which is the United States mail system.

87
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,810
Which uses character recognition to route mail incredibly efficiently.

88
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,305
There's a lot more detail here around exactly how this works.

89
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,569
I recommend classes on Machine Learning 101,

90
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:31,560
if you're interested in further diving into the details of the mathematics.
