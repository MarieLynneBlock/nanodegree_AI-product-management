1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,450
So an example of a customer of ours,

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,970
that is Blue River technologies.

3
00:00:05,969 --> 00:00:10,785
They were recently purchased by John Deere for over $300 million,

4
00:00:10,785 --> 00:00:15,353
and they operated a technology that was put on tractors

5
00:00:15,353 --> 00:00:16,859
to help distinguish between,

6
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:19,589
what is a weed and what is a plant.

7
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:25,425
So what they were doing is using computer vision to identify, "Hey,

8
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:28,335
this is a weed and it's outlined in red here,

9
00:00:28,335 --> 00:00:31,350
and this is a plant that we're actually interested in

10
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:34,770
growing a crop which you can see outlined in green."

11
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,320
What that ended up resulting in from a business application perspective,

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,950
is that the tractor was able to only spray herbicides

13
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,290
on the weeds and not the crops.

14
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:51,109
Which resulted in a 90 percent reduction in actual herbicide use,

15
00:00:51,109 --> 00:00:53,630
and a lot less going into the water table.

16
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,580
Which is not only great for the environment,

17
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:57,799
but also reduces costs significantly.

18
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:02,959
It would've been impossible for folks to hire enough people and

19
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,390
staff that's in a way where you could selectively

20
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:08,614
spray herbicide in such a granular and narrower way.

21
00:01:08,614 --> 00:01:09,949
It was just untenable.

22
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,094
But using AI technology,

23
00:01:12,094 --> 00:01:15,230
you can do this at scale which is really cool.
